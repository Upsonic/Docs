## Overview

Initializing an Agent Project sets up the foundation for building your AI agent. This process involves creating a virtual environment, installing the Upsonic CLI, and generating the project structure with template files.

<Info>
If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it by following the instructions at [this link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Creating Virtual Environment

Before installing Upsonic, create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:


```bash
# Initializing uv
uv init

# Using uv
uv venv

# Naming
uv venv my-name

# Setting up python version
uv venv --python 3.11


# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

.venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
```

## Installing Upsonic CLI

Install Upsonic using pip:

```bash
uv add upsonic
```

This installs the `upsonic` command-line tool globally or within your virtual environment. Verify the installation:

```bash
upsonic
```

## Initialize your Agent Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
upsonic init
```

The CLI will prompt you for an agent name. This creates:
- `agent.py`: Template agent file with a basic `main()` function
- `upsonic_config.json`: Configuration file with your agent's metadata, schemas, and dependencies

The generated `agent.py` includes a simple example that uses Upsonic's Agent class to process questions. You can customize this file to implement your agent's specific logic.

## Run your Agent Project

After initialization, install the required dependencies:

```bash
upsonic install
```

This installs all dependencies listed in the `api` section of `upsonic_config.json`, including FastAPI and uvicorn.

Then start your agent as a FastAPI server:

```bash
upsonic run
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:8000`. You can customize the host and port:

```bash
upsonic run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Access the interactive API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` to test your agent's endpoint.
