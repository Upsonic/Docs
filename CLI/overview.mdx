## What is Agent Project?

An Agent Project is a structured way to build production-ready AI agents using Upsonic. It provides a standardized project structure with:

- **Agent Logic**: Your agent's core functionality defined in `agent.py`
- **Configuration**: Project settings, input/output schemas, and dependencies in `upsonic_config.json`
- **FastAPI Integration**: Automatic API generation from your agent configuration
- **Dependency Management**: Organized dependency sections for API, Streamlit, and development tools

Agent Projects enable you to quickly scaffold, develop, and deploy AI agents as RESTful APIs with minimal boilerplate code.

## How Agent Project Works

When you initialize an Agent Project, Upsonic creates two essential files:

1. **`agent.py`**: Contains your agent's `main()` function that processes inputs and returns outputs
2. **`upsonic_config.json`**: Defines your agent's metadata, input/output schemas, dependencies, and runtime configuration

The framework automatically:
- Generates a FastAPI server from your configuration
- Creates OpenAPI documentation with interactive forms
- Handles both JSON and multipart/form-data requests
- Validates inputs and outputs based on your schema definitions
- Manages dependencies across different environments

Your agent's `main()` function receives inputs as a dictionary, processes them using Upsonic's Agent class, and returns a dictionary with results. The FastAPI server exposes this as a `/call` endpoint that can be consumed by any HTTP client.
