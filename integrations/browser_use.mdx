Browser Use is essentially a sub-agent mechanism developed for navigating websites, extracting data, filling forms, and taking actions. Thanks to its intelligently designed structure, it can easily work with almost all LLMs and achieves very high scores in the Voyager benchmark.

If you need the agent you're designing to navigate a website or take actions on it, you can easily do this both locally and within the Secure Runtime using Upsonic and browser-use integration.

<Warning>
  Currently, Computer Use is not supported in the deepseek models.
