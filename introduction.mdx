# What is Upsonic?

**Task oriented AI agent framework for digital workers and vertical AI agents.**

Upsonic offers a cutting-edge enterprise-ready framework where you can orchestrate LLM calls, agents, and computer use to complete tasks cost-effectively.

It provides more reliable agents, scalability, and a task-oriented structure that you need while completing real-world cases.

```bash
pip install upsonic
```

```python
from upsonic import Task, Agent

task = Task("Who developed you?")

agent = Agent(name="Coder")

agent.print_do(task)
```
