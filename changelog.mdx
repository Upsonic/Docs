> Product updates, improvements, and bug fixes for Upsonic


<Update label="Nov 6, 2025">
	## v0.66.1
	[View releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Upsonic/Upsonic/releases/v0.66.1)
	
	## Improvements:
	- **Ollama Model Configuration**: Enhanced Ollama provider integration by enabling "model as string" support, allowing simplified string-based model configuration instead of requiring model class instantiation. Users can now specify Ollama models using the convenient `"ollama/model-name"` string format, making it easier to switch between models and configure them via environment variables.

	## Bug Fixes:
	- **Model Configuration**: Improved model initialization flow for Ollama provider to ensure proper string-based model handling and compatibility with existing Upsonic model interfaces.
