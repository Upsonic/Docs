	## v0.70.0

	[View releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Upsonic/Upsonic/releases/v0.70.0)
	
	## New Features:
	- Agent Run Implementation: Introduced "Agent Run" architecture with `AgentRunInput` and `AgentRunOutput` dataclasses, providing type safety, clear contracts, and a single source of truth for agent execution state.
	- Memory Modes for UEL: Added `user_memory_mode` parameter with 'update' and 'replace' options to solve conflicts between placeholder history and model history.
	- AgentSession Class: New session management class for storing agent-related information across multiple runs with proper lifecycle management.
	- Parallel Tool Call Support: Added support for parallel tool calls when external tool execution is enabled, improving throughput for multi-tool operations.
	- Agent Metadata Attribute: New `metadata` attribute in Agent class that enables users to inject any metadata directly into the prompt.
	- Dynamic Search Tool for KnowledgeBase: Introduced dynamic `search` tool when KnowledgeBase is used as a tool (RAG as tool functionality).
	- MCP Tool Name Prefix: Added tool name prefix support for MCP tools, allowing different function tools with the same name to be used for different purposes.
	- RunRequirement Class: New class for managing Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) requirements with clear distinction between confirmation, user input, and external execution needs.
	- Run Cancellation Manager: Thread-safe cancellation management with proper lifecycle methods (`register_run`, `cancel_run`, `cleanup_run`).
	- External Tool Callable Support: For one-tool-at-a-time calls with external tool execution, callable is provided as argument for background handling.
	- Debug Level 2: Enhanced debugging capabilities with additional logging and visibility.
	
	## Improvements:
	- Context Managers Refactored: Converted context managers to regular classes to align with the step-based architecture in Agent flow.
	- HITL Logic Refactored: Human-in-the-Loop logics are now managed by the `RunRequirement` class with improved and cleaner usage patterns.
	- Streaming Logic Refactored: Removed unnecessary and confusing stream methods in Agent class, consolidating streaming functionality.
	- Storage Providers Refactored: Comprehensive storage system overhaul with abstract `Storage` base class and support for multiple backends (In-Memory, JSON, SQLite, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mem0).
	- Improved Event System: Enhanced event streaming architecture with comprehensive event types for better observability.
	- Test Organization: Reorganized tests by moving smoke tests from unit_tests directory into dedicated smoke_tests directory for clearer separation.
	- AgentRunContext Removal: Removed `AgentRunContext` class and made everything dependent on `AgentRunOutput` for simplified state management.
	
	## Bug Fixes:
	- Fixed System Prompt Setup: Resolved issue where system prompt was not being set up correctly in certain scenarios.
	- Fixed Test Compatibility: Addressed test compatibility issues across different Python versions.
	- Fixed Notebook Issues: Resolved issues with Jupyter notebook examples.
