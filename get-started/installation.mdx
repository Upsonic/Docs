## Made with Love 💚

At Upsonic, we believe in giving developers choice and flexibility. That's why we've built our framework with a layered architecture—you only install what you need, when you need it.

Want to build a simple agent? Just install the main library. Need RAG pipelines? Add the `rag` package. Building OCR workflows? Install `ocr`. Every feature is modular, every dependency is optional, and nothing bloats your project unnecessarily.

We designed Upsonic this way because we know your time, disk space, and deployment speed matter. No forced dependencies, no unnecessary packages—just clean, efficient, developer-friendly architecture.

Because we build Upsonic with love, for developers who love to build. 💚

## Optional Dependencies

Depending on your use case, you may need additional packages:

### RAG

Install RAG dependencies for vector databases and knowledge base operations:

```bash
pip install "upsonic[rag]"
```

Use this when you need to build RAG pipelines with vector databases like Qdrant, ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.

### Storage

Install storage backends for memory and state persistence:

```bash
pip install "upsonic[storage]"
```

Use this when you need databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, or SQLite for memory management.

### Models

Install additional LLM provider integrations:

```bash
pip install "upsonic[models]"
```

Use this when you need providers like Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere, Groq, Mistral, or Azure OpenAI.

### Embeddings

```bash
pip install "upsonic[loaders]"
```

Use this when you need to process PDF, DOCX, CSV, Markdown, YAML, HTML, or other document formats.
