Install Upsonic and start building AI agents in minutes.

Upsonic requires Python 3.10 or higher. Follow the steps below to install the framework and verify your installation.


## UV Package Manager | For Faster Installations
UV is a fast and efficient package manager for Python. Use uv for a better experience. That said, our framework is compatible with both uv and pip, so you don't need to choose one. UV is just the faster option.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Main Library

Install the core Upsonic framework to start building AI agents:

```bash
uv pip install upsonic
# pip install upsonic
```

This installs the main framework with all essential features including agents, tasks, teams, memory, tools, and LLM integrations.

<Note>
  **Python Version Requirements**

  Upsonic requires `Python >=3.10`. Here's how to check your version:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

  If you need to update Python, visit [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)

## Made with Love 💚

At Upsonic, we believe in giving developers choice and flexibility. That's why we've built our framework with a layered architecture: you only install what you need, when you need it.

Want to build a simple agent? Just install the main library. Need RAG pipelines? Add the `rag` package. Building OCR workflows? Install `ocr`. Every feature is modular, every dependency is optional, and nothing bloats your project unnecessarily.

We designed Upsonic this way because we know your time, disk space, and deployment speed matter. No forced dependencies, no unnecessary packages. Just clean, efficient, developer-friendly architecture.

Because we build Upsonic with love, for developers who love to build. 💚

## Optional Dependencies

Depending on your use case, you may need additional packages:

### RAG

Install RAG dependencies for vector databases and knowledge base operations:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[rag]"
# pip install "upsonic[rag]"
```

Use this when you need to build RAG pipelines with vector databases like Qdrant, ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.

### Storage

Install storage backends for memory and state persistence:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[storage]"
# pip install "upsonic[storage]"
```

Use this when you need databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, or SQLite for memory management.

### Models

Install additional LLM provider integrations:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[models]"
# pip install "upsonic[models]"
```

Use this when you need providers like Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere, Groq, Mistral, or Azure OpenAI.

### Embeddings

Install embedding model providers:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[embeddings]"
# pip install "upsonic[embeddings]"
```

Use this when you need embedding models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, HuggingFace, or local FastEmbed.

### Loaders

Install loaders to work with various file formats in your knowledge base:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[loaders]"
# pip install "upsonic[loaders]"
```

Use this when you need to process PDF, DOCX, CSV, Markdown, YAML, HTML, or other document formats.

### Tools

Install pre-built tools for web search and data retrieval:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[tools]"
# pip install "upsonic[tools]"
```

Use this when you need tools like DuckDuckGo search, Tavily, Yahoo Finance, or web scraping capabilities.

### OCR

Install OCR capabilities to extract text from images and scanned documents:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[ocr]"
# pip install "upsonic[ocr]"
```

Use this when you need OCR providers like EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, Tesseract, or RapidOCR.

### Web

Install web server dependencies for deploying agents as APIs:

```bash
uv pip install "upsonic[web]"
# pip install "upsonic[web]"
```

Use this when you need to deploy agents with FastAPI/Uvicorn or use Celery for background tasks.

## Verify Installation

Check your installed version:

```bash
uv pip freeze | grep upsonic
# pip freeze | grep upsonic
```

You should see something like:

```
upsonic==X.X.X
```

<Check>
  Installation successful! You're ready to create your first Agent and Task.
