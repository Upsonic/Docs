# Welcome to Upsonic

Upsonic is a complete AI agent infrastructure designed for production environments. It consists of two main components that work together seamlessly:

- **Upsonic Framework**: An open-source Python framework for building AI agents
- **Upsonic AgentOS**: A deployment and management platform for production agents

## What is Upsonic Framework?

Upsonic Framework is a production-ready toolkit for building safety-first AI agents and multi-agent teams. Unlike other frameworks, we focus on what matters most for real-world deployments: **safety, reliability, and enterprise-grade features**.

### Core Capabilities

The framework provides everything you need to build sophisticated AI agents:

- **Agents & Teams**: Create autonomous agents and coordinate multi-agent teams
- **Safety Engine**: Enforce policies and guardrails on agent behavior (our most differentiating feature)
- **Memory Systems**: Maintain context across conversations and sessions
- **Knowledge Base**: RAG pipelines with vector database integrations
- **OCR Support**: Extract text from images and documents with multiple providers
- **Tools & MCP**: Extend agents with custom tools and Model Context Protocol servers
- **Human in the Loop**: Pause execution for human review and approval when needed

### Quick Start

Install Upsonic and create your first agent in seconds:

```shellscript
uv pip install upsonic
# pip install upsonic
```

Put your API keys into your .env file

<CodeGroup>

```shellscript OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```


```shellscript Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-***
```


```shellscript Ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1/"
```

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```python OpenAI
from upsonic import Task, Agent

task = Task("Who developed you?")

agent = Agent(name="Coder", model="openai/gpt-5-mini")

agent.print_do(task)
```


```python Anthropic

from upsonic import Task, Agent

task = Task("Who developed you?")

agent = Agent(name="Coder", model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

agent.print_do(task)
```


```python Ollama

from upsonic import Task, Agent

task = Task("Who developed you?")

agent = Agent(name="Coder", model="ollama/llama3.2")

agent.print_do(task)
```

## What is Upsonic AgentOS?

AgentOS is an enterprise deployment and management platform that transforms your AI agents into production-ready microservices. Think of it as the Kubernetes for AI agents—providing scalability, monitoring, and operational excellence.

### Why AgentOS?

Moving from development to production is hard. AgentOS solves the operational challenges:

- **K8s-based FastAPI runtime**: Deploy agents as isolated, scalable microservices that integrate seamlessly with your existing infrastructure
- **Cost & Metric Dashboard**: Track every agent transaction, LLM cost, token usage, and performance metric in real-time
- **On-premise Deployment**: Keep your data and agents within your infrastructure for security and compliance
- **One-Click Deployment**: Go from code to production-ready API in minutes
- **Version Control**: Deploy from GitHub repositories with automatic updates

## Why Upsonic?

At Upsonic, we don't just build features in isolation. We listen to our community and prioritize what matters most to you. Right now, that means doubling down on Safety and OCR capabilities: two areas our users have made clear are critical for production workloads.

And of course, we've got you covered on the fundamentals. Upsonic ships with all the core features you'd expect from a modern framework, so you're never trading off functionality for innovation.

TL;DR: We're focused on what you need (Safety + OCR), while delivering everything you expect.

### Safety Engine

**It's our most differentiating feature in the competition.** In the current development cycle of agents, the main problem is being sure about safety. There are lots of wrong ways and potential problems that go against your company policy. So we made a feature where you can create policies, put them on your agents, and track them. This way you'll see your safety policies enforced on your agents. And it's an LLM-agnostic feature, so you can use your policies on any agent once you create them.

### OCR

In our framework, we directly support many local and cloud OCR providers to speed up this process. This way, developers don't need to struggle with the OCR step anymore. You can directly use all OCRs from one unified interface.
