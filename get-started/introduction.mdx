## Upsonic Framework

You can use the Upsonic Framework to build safety-first AI Agents or teams with Memory, KnowledgeBase, OCR, Human in the Loop, tools and MCP Support. The Upsonic framework orchestrates all of the operations with its pipeline architecture.

You are able to create complex and basic agents in one unified system. Our development process is based on what our community wants. Currently we are doubling down on Safety Engine and OCR capabilities.

```shellscript
pip install upsonic
```

```python
from upsonic import Task, Agent

task = Task("Who developed you?")

agent = Agent(name="Coder")

agent.print_do(task)
```

## Why Upsonic?

At Upsonic, we don't just build features in isolation. We listen to our community and prioritize what matters most to you. Right now, that means doubling down on Safety and OCR capabilitiesâ€”two areas our users have made clear are critical for production workloads.

And of course, we've got you covered on the fundamentals. Upsonic ships with all the core features you'd expect from a modern framework, so you're never trading off functionality for innovation.

TL;DR: We're focused on what you need (Safety + OCR), while delivering everything you expect.

### Safety Engine

**It's our most differentiating feature in the competition.** In the current development cycle of agents, the main problem is being sure about safety. There are lots of wrong ways and potential problems that go against your company policy. So we made a feature where you can create policies, put them on your agents, and track them. This way you'll see your safety policies enforced on your agents. And it's an LLM-agnostic feature, so you can use your policies on any agent once you create them.

### OCR

In our framework, we directly support many local and cloud OCR providers to speed up this process. This way, developers don't need to struggle with the OCR step anymore. You can directly use all OCRs from one unified interface.
