## What is AgentOS?

AgentOS is a production-ready platform that transforms your AI agents into deployable, scalable services. When you deploy an agent to AgentOS, the platform automatically:

- **Creates API endpoints** - Your agent becomes accessible via REST API
- **Manages infrastructure** - Handles databases, message queues, and async workers
- **Provides observability** - Tracks metrics, costs, tokens, and execution history
- **Handles deployments** - Blue-green deployments, rollbacks, and versioning
- **Scales your agents** - Automatic scaling based on demand

You focus on building intelligent agents, AgentOS handles everything else.

## Installing Upsonic Framework

Install the Upsonic Framework to build your agents:

```bash
uv pip install upsonic
# pip install upsonic
```

The Upsonic Framework provides the tools to create AI agents with tasks, tools, memory, and more.

---

## Starting an Agent Project

Create a new agent project using the Upsonic CLI:

```bash
upsonic init
```

This command creates:
- **`upsonic_configs.json`** - Agent configuration (required)
- **`main.py`** - Your agent code (required)

Everything else is optional. You can add additional files, modules, and dependencies as needed.

---

## Building your Agent

### Required Files

Every agent needs two files:

1. **`upsonic_configs.json`** - Configuration file
2. **`main.py`** (or any `.py` file) - Agent implementation

### Adding Dependencies

Add Python packages to your agent:

```bash
upsonic install <package-name>
```

This command adds the package to `upsonic_configs.json` under dependencies.

### Example Agent Code

Here's a simple agent using the Upsonic Framework:

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Define your agent
agent = Agent(
    role="Research Assistant",
    goal="Help users find and analyze information",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with access to various tools"
)

# Create a task
task = Task(
    description="Research the latest trends in AI",
    expected_output="A summary of current AI trends",
    agent=agent
)

# Execute
result = agent.execute_task(task)
print(result)
```

## Deploy your Agent to the Platform

AgentOS supports two deployment methods: **Git** and **ZIP upload**.

### Deployment Process

<div className="step group/step relative flex items-start pb-5">
  <div className="flex-1">
    <h5>Step 1: Upload Agent Code</h5>
    Upload your agent to AgentOS using one of two methods:

    - **Git Provider** - Deploy from GitHub, GitLab, or Azure Repos
    - **ZIP Upload** - Direct upload without Git integration
  </div>
</div>

<div className="step group/step relative flex items-start pb-5">
  <div className="flex-1">
    <h5>Step 2: Configure Deployment</h5>
    Specify deployment configuration:

    - **Environment Variables** - Set custom env vars for your agent
    - **LLM Connection** - Select the AI model to use
    - **Machine Specification** - Choose CPU and RAM allocation
  </div>
</div>

<div className="step group/step relative flex items-start pb-5">
  <div className="flex-1">
    <h5>Step 3: Start Deployment</h5>
    Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process. AgentOS will:

    - Pull your code from Git or extract the ZIP
    - Install dependencies from `upsonic_configs.json`
    - Create containers and allocate resources
    - Start your agent and assign an API endpoint
  </div>
</div>

### Deploy from Git Provider

Deploy directly from your repository:

1. Push your agent code to your Git repository
2. In AgentOS, go to **New Agent Deployment**
3. Select **Deploy from Git**
4. Choose your repository and branch
5. Configure environment variables and LLM connection
6. Click **Deploy**

For detailed Git setup, see the [Git Connection](/agentos/concepts/git-connection) guide.

### Deploy from ZIP

Deploy without Git integration:

1. Compress your agent project folder into a ZIP file
2. In AgentOS, go to **New Agent Deployment**
3. Select **Deploy from ZIP**
4. Upload your ZIP file
5. Configure deployment settings
6. Click **Deploy**

For more details, see the [Git Connection - ZIP Deployment](/agentos/concepts/git-connection#zip-file-deployment-no-git) section.
