## What is an Agent?

After deploying an agent to AgentOS, it appears in the **Agents List** (`/agents/`) with an **Online** status. Click the **Manage** button to access the agent's detail page where you can monitor, test, and manage your agent.

Each deployed agent gets:
- Dedicated API endpoint (IP:port)
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Execution history tracking
- Performance metrics
- Scheduling capabilities

---

## Management Page

The agent management page provides complete control and visibility into your agent's operations.

### API Endpoint

Each agent is assigned a unique IP and port. For local environments:
- **First agent**: `http://0.0.0.0:7340`
- **Subsequent agents**: Sequential ports (7341, 7342, etc.)

### Making API Calls

Call your agent using the `/call` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:7340/call" \
  -F "Mail=example_Mail"
```

Get the result using the job ID:

```bash
curl "http://0.0.0.0:7340/result/JOB_ID"
```

### What You'll See

The management page displays:
- **Health Status** - API and Web UI health checks
- **API Endpoint** - Direct link to `/docs` for OpenAPI documentation
- **Example Code** - cURL, Python, JavaScript, and other language examples
- **Streamlit UI** - Access to the Streamlit interface (if available)
- **Test Endpoints** - Interactive API testing interface

## OpenAPI Documentation

Every agent automatically generates OpenAPI documentation. Access it at:

```
http://IP:PORT/docs
```

The documentation provides:
- Interactive API testing interface
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication details
- Example requests in multiple languages

---

## Executions

View the complete execution history of your agent, including:
- Timestamp of each execution
- Input parameters
- Output results
- Execution duration
- Success/failure status

Filter and search through executions to analyze your agent's performance over time.

## Benchmark

Compare your agent's performance across different LLM models to find the optimal configuration.

### How It Works

1. Select multiple LLM connections (configured in Settings)
2. Provide the same input parameters
3. AgentOS calls your agent with each model
4. Compare results side-by-side

### What You Can Compare

- **Cost** - API costs for each model
- **Response Time** - Inference speed comparison
- **Token Usage** - Token consumption analysis
- **Output Quality** - Manual comparison of responses

This helps you choose the most cost-effective and performant model for your use case.

## Metrics

Monitor your agent's performance with detailed metrics and visualizations.

AgentOS automatically tracks:
- **Total Calls** - Number of executions
- **Total Cost** - Cumulative API costs
- **Average Response Time** - Performance trends
- **Token Usage** - Input and output tokens

View both overall statistics and time-series graphs to identify trends and optimize performance.

For detailed information about metrics features and the platform-wide Usage page, see the [Metrics](/agentos/concepts/metrics) guide.

## Scheduling

Automate agent execution with flexible scheduling options.

Configure your agent to run automatically at specific times or intervals using:
- **Frequency-Based** - Hourly, daily, or weekly execution
- **Crontab Expression** - Custom schedules with cron syntax

For detailed scheduling configuration and examples, see the [Scheduling](/agentos/concepts/scheduling) guide.

## Deployments

Track your agent's deployment history and monitor deployment status.

### Deployment History

View all deployments with:
- **Deployment Status** - Success or failure
- **Timestamp** - When the deployment occurred
- **Commit Hash** - Git commit used for deployment (helps identify which code version is running)
- **Failure Reasons** - Detailed error messages for failed deployments

This helps you track changes and understand which version of your code is currently deployed.
