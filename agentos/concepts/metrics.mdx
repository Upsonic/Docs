## What are Metrics?

AgentOS automatically tracks and visualizes key performance indicators for your agents. Monitor costs, usage, response times, and token consumption to optimize your agents' performance and manage expenses effectively.

For detailed information about agent metrics features, see the [Agent - Metrics](/agentos/concepts/agent#metrics) section.

## Tracked Metrics

AgentOS collects the following metrics for each agent:

- **Total Calls** - Number of API requests to your agent
- **Total Cost** - Cumulative costs from LLM API usage
- **Average Response Time** - Mean execution duration
- **Token Usage** - Input and output tokens consumed

All metrics are tracked in real-time and displayed with both aggregate statistics and time-series visualizations.

## Agent Metrics Page

View detailed metrics for individual agents on the agent's Metrics tab.

### What You'll See

- **Overall Statistics** - Total calls, costs, response times, and tokens
- **Time-Series Graphs** - Visualize trends over time
- **Cost Breakdown** - Track spending per agent
- **Performance Trends** - Identify patterns and anomalies

This page helps you understand a single agent's behavior and optimize its configuration for better performance and cost efficiency.
