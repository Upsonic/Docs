## What is a Git Connection?

Git Connections allow AgentOS to pull your agent code directly from your repositories. When you push changes to your repository, AgentOS can automatically deploy the updated version of your agent.

**Required Permissions:**
- Organization/Repository read access
- Pull permissions
- Commit history access

## ZIP File Deployment (No Git)

For quick deployments without Git integration, use the ZIP upload method alongside your Git providers.

You can use ZIP deployment even when you have Git providers configured. This is useful for:
- Quick testing and prototyping
- Deploying agents without repository setup
- One-off deployments

### How to Deploy with ZIP

1. Create your agent project using `upsonic init`
2. Compress the project folder into a ZIP file
3. Navigate to **New Agent Deployment**
4. Select **Deploy from ZIP**
5. Upload your ZIP file
6. Configure deployment settings
7. Click **Deploy**

## Multiple Deployment Options

AgentOS allows you to configure **one Git provider** and use **ZIP upload** alongside it.

You can choose one of the following Git providers:
- GitHub
- GitLab (Cloud or Self-Managed)
- Azure Repos (Cloud or Enterprise)

And use ZIP upload at the same time for quick deployments without Git.

**Benefits:**
- Use Git for version-controlled deployments
- Use ZIP for quick testing and prototyping
- No need to commit every change during development
- Production agents from Git, test agents from ZIP
