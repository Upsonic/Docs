## What is Scheduling?

Scheduling allows you to automate agent execution at specific times or intervals. Instead of manually calling your agent's API, you can configure AgentOS to run your agent automatically based on your requirements.

For detailed information about agent scheduling features, see the [Agent - Scheduling](/agentos/concepts/agent#scheduling) section.

## Frequency-Based Scheduling

Simple interval-based execution for common use cases:

- **Hourly** - Runs at the first minute of every hour (e.g., 16:00, 17:00)
- **Daily** - Runs at 00:00 every day
- **Weekly** - Runs at 00:00 every Monday

## Crontab Expressions

For advanced scheduling needs, use cron syntax to define custom schedules:

```
Minute (0-59)    Hour (0-23)    Day (1-31)    Month (1-12)    Weekday (0-6)
    *                *              *              *              *
```

**Syntax Rules:**
- Use `*` for any value
- Use numbers for specific values
- Use comma-separated values (e.g., `1,3,5`)

**Examples:**
- `0 9 * * 1` - 9am every Monday
- `30 */2 * * *` - Every 2 hours at 30 minutes
- `0 0 * * 0` - Midnight every Sunday
