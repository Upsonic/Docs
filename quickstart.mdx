In Upsonic you can generate an task oriented structure with task **description**, **tools**, **context**, **knowledge bases** and etc. In this example we will give `Search` tools to our task. The agent will use the `Search` tool at the run time.

    ```python
    from upsonic import Task, Agent
    from upsonic.client.tools import Search
    
    task = Task(
