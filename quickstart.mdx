## Build your first Upsonic Agent

Letâ€™s create a simple agent that is an expert on our company and serves as Product Manager.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `Upsonic` installed.
If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to configure your sonics\! ðŸ¦”

<Steps>
  <Step title="Providing OpenAI API Key">
    Upsonic supports multiple LLMs. In this example, we will use OpenAI's GPT-4 model, for which we need to set environment variables.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    import os
    
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-***"
    ```

    
    ```bash Mac
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    
    ```

    
    ```powershell Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate your First Task">
    The task-centric structure is important to create a programmatic design in agent systems. With Upsonic, you can generate a task-oriented structure with task ** descriptions**, **tools**, **context**, **knowledge bases**, etc. In this example, weâ€™ll assign the `Search` tool to our task, which the agent will use at runtime.

    ```python
    from upsonic import Task, Agent
    from upsonic.client.tools import Search
    
    task = Task(
      "Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", 
      tools=[Search]
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an Expert Agent of Our Company">
    Upsonic **automatic role-configuration** system allows you to create agents tailored to your needs. In this example we'll generate a Product Manager agent.

    ```python
    agent = Agent("Product Manager")
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Running the Task on Agent">
    ```python
    # Running the task
    agent.print_do(task)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect Any MCP

The Upsonic framework supports starting and connecting to any MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for your needs. MCP servers vary in configuration and are maintained by both companies and the community. Upsonic is compatible with all MCP server implementations.

At this step you need to use  `@client.mcp()` decorator on a class, providing the **command**, **args** and **env.**

```python
@client.mcp()
class FetchMCP:
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    # env = {"": ""}
  

task1 = Task(
  "Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", 
  tools=[FetchMCP]
)
```
