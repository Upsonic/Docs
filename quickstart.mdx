## Build your first Upsonic Agent

Let's create a simple agent that expert on our company and roled as Product Manager.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `Upsonic` installed.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get your sonics! ðŸ¦”



<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating Client">
    Upsonic base on Server and Client architecture. In this example we will create an `localserver` to run our agent in our envinronment. This architecture helps you to be able to scale your agents.

    ```python
    from upsonic import UpsonicClient, ObjectResponse, Task, AgentConfiguration
    from upsonic.client.tools import Search

    # Create Client and and Set Configurations
    client = UpsonicClient("localserver")

    # Set OpenAI Configuration
    client.set_config("OPENAI_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")

    ```




  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate your First Task">
    The task-centric structure important to create an programatic design in Agent systems. In Upsonic you can generate an task oriented structure with task **description**, **tools**, **context**, **knowledge bases** and etc. In this example we will give `Search` tools to our task. The agent will use the `Search` tool at the run time.



    ```python

    task1 = Task(
      description="Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", 
      tools=[Search]
    )
    ```


  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate an Expert Agent of Our Company">
    Upsonic have an **automatic characterization** mechanism. Its important to create agents that belongs on your company. Upsonic visit the `company_url`, read the `job_title` and `company_objective` and creates an **enhanced profile** for your agent.



    ```python
    product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
        job_title="Product Manager",
        company_url="https://upsonic.ai",
        company_objective="To build AI Agent framework that helps people get things done",
    )
    ```




  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the Task on Agent">
    ```python
    # Running the task
    client.agent(product_manager_agent, task1)

    # Getting the result from task1 object
    result = task1.response
    print(result)
    ```
