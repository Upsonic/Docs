## Build your first Upsonic Agent

Let's create a simple agent that expert on our company and roled as Product Manager.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `Upsonic` installed.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get your sonics! ðŸ¦”

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating Client">
    Upsonic base on Server and Client architecture. In this example we will create an `localserver` to run our agent in our envinronment. This architecture helps you to be able to scale your agents.

    ```python
    from upsonic import UpsonicClient, ObjectResponse, Task, AgentConfiguration
    from upsonic.client.tools import Search

    # Create Client and and Set Configurations
    client = UpsonicClient("localserver")

    # Set OpenAI Configuration
    client.set_config("OPENAI_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate your First Task">
    The task-centric structure important to create an programatic design in Agent systems. In Upsonic you can generate an task oriented structure with task **description**, **tools**, **context**, **knowledge bases** and etc. In this example we will give `Search` tools to our task. The agent will use the `Search` tool at the run time.

    ```python

    task1 = Task(
      description="Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", 
      tools=[Search]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate an Expert Agent of Our Company">
    Upsonic have an **automatic characterization** mechanism. Its important to create agents that belongs on your company. Upsonic visit the `company_url`, read the `job_title` and `company_objective` and creates an **enhanced profile** for your agent.

    ```python
    product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
        job_title="Product Manager",
        company_url="https://upsonic.ai",
        company_objective="To build AI Agent framework that helps people get things done",
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Running the Task on Agent">
    ```python
    # Running the task
    client.agent(product_manager_agent, task1)

    # Getting the result from task1 object
    result = task1.response
    print(result)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect Any MCP

Upsonic framework, support to start and connect any MCP server for your purposes. Model Context Protocol servers are varously and maintain by companies and community. Upsonic support all MCP servers.

* [List of mcp servers](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers?attributes=)

At this step you need to use  `@client.mcp()` decorator to an class with **command**, **args** and **env.**&#x20;

```python
# Hackernews MCP Server

@client.mcp()
class HackerNewsMCP:
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["mcp-hn"]
    # env = {"": ""}
    
 
# Creating Task with Tool 
tools = [HackerNewsMCP]   

task1 = Task(
  description="Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", 
  tools=tools
)
```

## Computer Use Integration

Upsonic agents able to make Computer Use operations. For now Anthropic Computer use Supported. OpenAI Operator coming soon.

This feature important to interact with systems which dont have any API. Computer use is an aiblity to click something on the screen by understanding the location as LLM Modal.

<Note>
  For this feature you need to use Anthropic `claude-3-5-sonnet` model.
</Note>

```python

# Importing the ComputerUse
from upsonic.client.tools import ComputerUse


# Creating Task with ComputerUse Ability
tools = [ComputerUse]   

task1 = Task(
  description="Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", 
  tools=tools
)
```
