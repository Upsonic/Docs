## What is Safety Engine?


The Safety Engine is a powerful content filtering and policy enforcement system that helps you maintain safe, appropriate, and compliant AI interactions. Just like humans need guidelines and rules to ensure appropriate behavior, AI agents need safety policies to filter content, block inappropriate material, and protect sensitive information.

The key benefits of the Safety Engine are:

- **Content Filtering**: Automatically detect and block inappropriate content like adult material, hate speech, or sensitive topics
- **Privacy Protection**: Anonymize or redact sensitive information like phone numbers, emails, or personal data
- **Compliance**: Ensure your AI applications meet regulatory requirements and platform policies
- **Customizable**: Create your own policies or use pre-built ones for common use cases
- **Dual Protection**: Apply policies to both user input (user_policy) and agent output (agent_policy)

## Core Principles For Safety Policies

When implementing safety policies, consider these important elements:

- **Policy Types**: Choose between blocking, anonymizing, or raising exceptions based on your needs
- **Detection Methods**: Use keyword-based detection for speed or LLM-based detection for accuracy
- **Input vs Output**: Apply user_policy to filter incoming requests and agent_policy to filter outgoing responses
- **Language Support**: Policies can detect and respond in multiple languages automatically
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Policies use confidence scores to determine when to take action

### Understanding Policy Actions

**Blocking Policies**: Completely prevent content from being processed and return a block message
**Anonymization Policies**: Replace sensitive information with safe alternatives while preserving context
**Exception Policies**: Raise exceptions that stop execution when inappropriate content is detected

## Policy Types and Use Cases

### Blocking Policies

- **CryptoBlockPolicy**: Essential for banks and financial institutions to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations
- **AdultContentBlockPolicy**: Required for professional banking environments and customer-facing applications
- **SensitiveSocialBlockPolicy**: Critical for maintaining professional communication standards in financial services

### Anonymization Policies

- **AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy**: Protects customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) by replacing phone numbers with safe alternatives
- **AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy_LLM_Finder**: Uses AI for more accurate detection of phone numbers and other sensitive data in customer communications

### Exception Policies

- **CryptoRaiseExceptionPolicy**: Raises exceptions for compliance logging and regulatory reporting when crypto-related content is detected
- **AdultContentRaiseExceptionPolicy**: Stops execution and logs incidents for audit trails in professional banking environments

## Let's Create a Banking Assistant with Compliance Controls

In this example, we'll create a banking assistant that enforces financial regulations and protects sensitive customer information.

```python
# Upsonic Docs: Add a Safety Engine
# https://docs.upsonic.ai/guides/3-add-a-safety-engine

# Imports
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine import CryptoBlockPolicy, AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy, SensitiveSocialBlockPolicy

# Banking Assistant with Multiple Safety Policies
banking_assistant = Agent(
    name="Banking Assistant V1",
    role="Certified banking assistant providing financial guidance",
    goal="Help customers with banking services while maintaining regulatory compliance and data protection",
    instructions="""
    You are a banking assistant. Provide information about traditional banking products 
    like savings accounts, checking accounts, loans, and investment products.
    Always comply with banking regulations and protect customer privacy.
    """,
    user_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy,  # Block cryptocurrency content per banking regulations
    agent_policy=AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy  # Protect customer phone numbers in responses
)

# Test Task with Crypto Content (Should be Blocked)
crypto_task = Task(
    description="I want to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum through my bank account. Can you help me set up crypto trading?",
    response_format=str
)

# Test Task with Safe Banking Content (Should Pass)
safe_task = Task(
    description="I'm 25 years old and want to open a high-yield savings account. What are the best options available?",
    response_format=str
)

# Test Task with Sensitive Information (Should be Anonymized)
privacy_task = Task(
    description="My phone number is +1-555-123-4567. Can you help me update my contact information?",
    response_format=str
)

# Run the tasks
print("=== Testing Crypto Content (Should be Blocked) ===")
banking_assistant.print_do(crypto_task)

print("\n=== Testing Safe Banking Content (Should Pass) ===")
banking_assistant.print_do(safe_task)

print("\n=== Testing Privacy Protection (Should Anonymize) ===")
banking_assistant.print_do(privacy_task)

print("Crypto Task Result:", crypto_task.response)
print("Safe Task Result:", safe_task.response[:100] + "...")
print("Privacy Task Result:", privacy_task.response)
```

## Creating Custom Safety Policies

You can build policies that integrate seamlessly with your AI agents.

### Policy Architecture Overview

Custom policies follow a three-component architecture:

1. **Rule**: Defines what content to detect (using regex patterns or LLM-based detection)
2. **Action**: Specifies what to do when content is detected (block, anonymize, or raise exception)
3. **Policy**: Combines the rule and action into a complete safety policy

### Step-by-Step Custom Policy Creation

Let's create a custom policy to protect credit card information in a financial application:

#### Step 1: Create the Rule Class

```python
import re
from typing import List
from upsonic.safety_engine.base import RuleBase
from upsonic.safety_engine.models import PolicyInput, RuleOutput

class CreditCardDetectionRule(RuleBase):
    """Rule to detect credit card numbers"""
    
    name = "Credit Card Detection Rule"
    description = "Detects credit card numbers in various formats"
    language = "en"  # Default language for this rule
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Regex pattern for credit card numbers (supports major card types)
        self.pattern = r'\b(?:\d{4}[-\s]?){3}\d{4}\b'
    
    def process(self, policy_input: PolicyInput) -> RuleOutput:
        """Process input texts for credit card detection"""
        
        # Combine all input texts
        combined_text = " ".join(policy_input.input_texts or [])
        
        # Find matching credit card numbers
        triggered_cards = []
        for match in re.finditer(self.pattern, combined_text):
            card_number = match.group(0).replace(" ", "").replace("-", "")
            # Basic Luhn algorithm validation
            if self._is_valid_credit_card(card_number):
                triggered_cards.append(match.group(0))
        
        # Calculate confidence based on number of matches
        if not triggered_cards:
            return RuleOutput(
                confidence=0.0,
                content_type="CREDIT_CARD",
                details="No credit card numbers detected"
            )
        
        return RuleOutput(
            confidence=1.0,
            content_type="CREDIT_CARD",
            details=f"Detected {len(triggered_cards)} credit card numbers",
            triggered_keywords=triggered_cards
        )
    
    def _is_valid_credit_card(self, card_number: str) -> bool:
        """Validate credit card using Luhn algorithm"""
        def luhn_checksum(card_num):
            def digits_of(n):
                return [int(d) for d in str(n)]
            digits = digits_of(card_num)
            odd_digits = digits[-1::-2]
            even_digits = digits[-2::-2]
            checksum = sum(odd_digits)
            for d in even_digits:
                checksum += sum(digits_of(d*2))
            return checksum % 10
        
        return luhn_checksum(card_number) == 0
```

#### Step 2: Create the Action Class

```python
from upsonic.safety_engine.base import ActionBase
from upsonic.safety_engine.models import RuleOutput, PolicyOutput

class CreditCardBlockAction(ActionBase):
    """Action to block content containing credit card numbers"""
    
    name = "Credit Card Block Action"
    description = "Blocks content containing credit card numbers"
    language = "en"  # Default language for this action
    
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        """Execute credit card blocking based on rule confidence"""
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            return self.raise_block_error(
                "Credit card information detected. For security reasons, please do not share credit card details in conversations."
            )
        else:
            return self.allow_content()

# Alternative: Replace Action for Credit Cards
class CreditCardReplaceAction(ActionBase):
    """Action to replace credit card numbers with safe placeholders"""
    
    name = "Credit Card Replace Action"
    description = "Replaces credit card numbers with safe placeholders"
    language = "en"
    
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        """Execute credit card replacement based on rule confidence"""
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            return self.replace_triggered_keywords("[CARD-NUMBER-REDACTED]")
        else:
            return self.allow_content()

# Alternative: Anonymize Action for Credit Cards
class CreditCardAnonymizeAction(ActionBase):
    """Action to anonymize credit card numbers with unique replacements"""
    
    name = "Credit Card Anonymize Action"
    description = "Anonymizes credit card numbers with unique replacements"
    language = "en"
    
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        """Execute credit card anonymization based on rule confidence"""
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            return self.anonymize_triggered_keywords()
        else:
            return self.allow_content()
```

#### Step 3: Create the Policy

```python
from upsonic.safety_engine.base import Policy

# Option 1: Block Policy (Complete blocking)
CreditCardBlockPolicy = Policy(
    name="Credit Card Block Policy",
    description="Blocks content containing credit card numbers for security",
    rule=CreditCardDetectionRule(),
    action=CreditCardBlockAction()
)

# Option 2: Replace Policy (Replace with placeholder)
CreditCardReplacePolicy = Policy(
    name="Credit Card Replace Policy",
    description="Replaces credit card numbers with safe placeholders",
    rule=CreditCardDetectionRule(),
    action=CreditCardReplaceAction()
)

# Option 3: Anonymize Policy (Unique anonymization)
CreditCardAnonymizePolicy = Policy(
    name="Credit Card Anonymize Policy",
    description="Anonymizes credit card numbers with unique replacements",
    rule=CreditCardDetectionRule(),
    action=CreditCardAnonymizeAction()
)
```

### Advanced: LLM-Enhanced Detection

For more sophisticated detection, you can use LLM-based rules that leverage AI for better accuracy:

```python
class CreditCardDetectionRule_LLM(RuleBase):
    """LLM-enhanced rule to detect credit card numbers and related financial information"""
    
    name = "Credit Card Detection Rule LLM"
    description = "Uses LLM to detect credit card numbers and financial information"
    language = "en"
    
    def process(self, policy_input: PolicyInput) -> RuleOutput:
        """Process input texts using LLM for enhanced detection"""
        
        # Use LLM to find financial information including credit cards
        triggered_keywords = self._llm_find_keywords_with_input("Credit Card Information", policy_input)
        
        if not triggered_keywords:
            return RuleOutput(
                confidence=0.0,
                content_type="CREDIT_CARD",
                details="No credit card information detected"
            )
        
        return RuleOutput(
            confidence=1.0,
            content_type="CREDIT_CARD",
            details=f"Detected {len(triggered_keywords)} instances of credit card information",
            triggered_keywords=triggered_keywords
        )

# Create LLM-enhanced policy
CreditCardBlockPolicy_LLM = Policy(
    name="Credit Card Block Policy LLM",
    description="Uses LLM to detect and block credit card information",
    rule=CreditCardDetectionRule_LLM(),
    action=CreditCardBlockAction()
)
```

### Policy Action Types

Choose the appropriate action type based on your security requirements:

#### 1. Allow Actions
```python
class AllowAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        # Always allow content to pass through
        return self.allow_content()
```

#### 2. Blocking Actions
```python
class BlockAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            return self.raise_block_error("Content blocked due to policy violation")
        return self.allow_content()
```

#### 3. Replace Actions
```python
class ReplaceAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            # Replace sensitive content with a safe placeholder
            return self.replace_triggered_keywords("[REDACTED]")
        return self.allow_content()
```

#### 4. Anonymization Actions
```python
class AnonymizeAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            # Replace with unique anonymized versions
            return self.anonymize_triggered_keywords()
        return self.allow_content()
```

#### 5. Exception Actions
```python
class ExceptionAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            # Raise exception to stop execution
            return self.raise_exception("Policy violation detected")
        return self.allow_content()
```

#### 6. LLM-Enhanced Blocking Actions
```python
class LLMBlockAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            # Use LLM to generate contextual block message
            return self.llm_raise_block_error("Sensitive information detected")
        return self.allow_content()
```

#### 7. LLM-Enhanced Exception Actions
```python
class LLMExceptionAction(ActionBase):
    def action(self, rule_result: RuleOutput) -> PolicyOutput:
        if rule_result.confidence >= 0.8:
            # Use LLM to generate contextual exception message
            return self.llm_raise_exception("Policy violation detected")
        return self.allow_content()
```

### Integrating Custom Policies with Agents

Once you've created your custom policy, integrate it with your AI agents:

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Example 1: Blocking Policy (Complete Security)
secure_agent_block = Agent(
    name="Secure Financial Assistant (Block Mode)",
    role="Financial advisor with strict security controls",
    goal="Provide financial guidance while blocking sensitive information",
    instructions="Help users with financial planning while maintaining strict security standards",
    user_policy=CreditCardBlockPolicy,  # Block credit cards in user input
    agent_policy=CreditCardBlockPolicy  # Block credit cards in agent output
)

# Example 2: Replace Policy (Content Preservation)
secure_agent_replace = Agent(
    name="Secure Financial Assistant (Replace Mode)",
    role="Financial advisor with content replacement",
    goal="Provide financial guidance while replacing sensitive information",
    instructions="Help users with financial planning while replacing sensitive data",
    user_policy=CreditCardReplacePolicy,  # Replace credit cards in user input
    agent_policy=CreditCardReplacePolicy  # Replace credit cards in agent output
)

# Example 3: Anonymize Policy (Unique Anonymization)
secure_agent_anonymize = Agent(
    name="Secure Financial Assistant (Anonymize Mode)",
    role="Financial advisor with anonymization",
    goal="Provide financial guidance while anonymizing sensitive information",
    instructions="Help users with financial planning while anonymizing sensitive data",
    user_policy=CreditCardAnonymizePolicy,  # Anonymize credit cards in user input
    agent_policy=CreditCardAnonymizePolicy  # Anonymize credit cards in agent output
)

# Test the different policies
test_task = Task(
    description="My credit card number is 4532-1234-5678-9012. Can you help me with my account?",
    response_format=str
)

print("=== Blocking Policy Test ===")
secure_agent_block.print_do(test_task)
print("Result:", test_task.response)

print("\n=== Replace Policy Test ===")
secure_agent_replace.print_do(test_task)
print("Result:", test_task.response)

print("\n=== Anonymize Policy Test ===")
secure_agent_anonymize.print_do(test_task)
print("Result:", test_task.response)
```

### Multi-Language Support

Custom policies automatically support multiple languages:

```python
class MultiLanguageCreditCardRule(RuleBase):
    """Credit card detection with multi-language support"""
    
    name = "Multi-Language Credit Card Rule"
    description = "Detects credit cards in multiple languages"
    language = "auto"  # Auto-detect language
    
    def process(self, policy_input: PolicyInput) -> RuleOutput:
        # The framework will automatically detect language and apply appropriate detection
        triggered_keywords = self._llm_find_keywords_with_input("Credit Card", policy_input)
        
        if not triggered_keywords:
            return RuleOutput(
                confidence=0.0,
                content_type="CREDIT_CARD",
                details="No credit card information detected"
            )
        
        return RuleOutput(
            confidence=1.0,
            content_type="CREDIT_CARD",
            details=f"Detected {len(triggered_keywords)} credit card instances",
            triggered_keywords=triggered_keywords
        )
```

### Advanced Configuration Options

Custom policies support advanced configuration for enterprise use cases:

```python
# Policy with custom LLM models
AdvancedCreditCardPolicy = Policy(
    name="Advanced Credit Card Policy",
    description="Advanced credit card detection with custom models",
    rule=CreditCardDetectionRule_LLM(),
    action=CreditCardBlockAction(),
    language="auto",  # Auto-detect language
    language_identify_model="gpt-4",  # Custom model for language detection
    base_model="gpt-4",  # Custom model for base operations
    text_finder_model="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Custom model for text finding
)
```

### Best Practices for Custom Policies

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with regex-based rules for performance, then enhance with LLM detection
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate your policies with diverse test cases
3. **Consider Performance**: Balance accuracy with processing speed
4. **Document Clearly**: Provide clear descriptions for policy maintenance
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Account for various input formats and languages
6. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track policy performance and adjust confidence thresholds

### Choosing the Right Action Type

Select the appropriate action based on your security requirements and use case:

| Action Type | Use Case | Security Level | Content Preservation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Allow** | Low-risk content, testing | Low | Full |
| **Replace** | Moderate risk, content flow needed | Medium | Partial (placeholder) |
| **Anonymize** | High risk, unique replacements needed | High | Partial (anonymized) |
| **Block** | Critical security, complete prevention | Very High | None |
| **Exception** | Compliance, audit trails | Very High | None |
