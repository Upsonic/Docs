## What is AgentOS?

AgentOS is a comprehensive platform that enables you to build and deploy AI agents with complete observability and management capabilities. With AgentOS, you can:

- **Build and deploy agents** with streamlined workflows
- **Monitor everything** - track metrics, token costs, API calls, response times, and execution history
- **Transform agents into APIs** - make your agents API-native and production-ready
- **Manage deployments** - handle the entire deployment lifecycle from a single interface

AgentOS handles migrations, databases, async job queues, and observability infrastructure automatically, letting you focus on building intelligent agents.

## What is the Agent Framework?

The framework is where you develop your agent, add functionality, and design its behavior. It is a Python-based library that includes several features to help you build production-grade agents. Key capabilities include:

- **Create a knowledge base** to handle large amounts of information
- **Create safety policies** to prevent hallucinations and unsafe answers
- **Design your own memory structure** to personalize your agent
- **Use Unified OCR** to read all kinds of PDFs and images

Just focus on your use case—Upsonic Agent Framework will handle the rest.

## Let's Create an Agent That Gives Information About Stocks

In this agent, the user provides a stock symbol and we ask the agent to analyze it. We’ll use a specific response format to make the output useful and consistent.

### Create an Agent Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="1) Pick your GitHub organization">
    In GitHub, click **New** (top-right) or go to your organization page and click **Repositories** → **New**.

    In the **Owner** dropdown, make sure you select your **Organization** (not your personal account).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2) Fill repo details (Name / Visibility)">
    Choose a repository name (e.g. `stock-agent`).

    Select **Visibility**:

    - **Private**: Only accessible within your org (recommended).
    - **Public**: Visible to everyone.

    Optionally add a short **Description**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3) Add starter files (README is required)">
    **Must do:** check **Add a README file** so GitHub creates the repository with an initial commit.

    Optionally:

    - **.gitignore**: choose Python.
    - **License**: choose the license your org uses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4) Create the repo and clone locally">
    Click **Create repository**.

    Then on the repo page: **Code** → copy SSH or HTTPS URL and clone locally:

    `git clone <repo-url>`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Install Upsonic CLI

We’ll use `uv` to manage the virtual environment and install the Upsonic CLI.

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
```

2. Install Upsonic CLI into the environment:

```bash
uv pip install upsonic
```

3. Verify the CLI works by printing the help output:

```bash
uv run upsonic --help
```

### Create Agent Project With "upsonic init"

1. Initialize a new agent project:

```bash
uv run upsonic init
```

2. When prompted, type your agent name into the input (e.g. `stock-agent`) and press Enter.

3. Install the project dependencies (required before running locally):

```bash
uv run upsonic install
```

### Code your Inputs and Outputs

Now define what your agent accepts as input and what it returns as output by editing `upsonic_configs.json`.

1. Open `upsonic_configs.json` and update the basic metadata:
   - **`agent_name`**: Your agent’s display name
   - **`description`**: What the agent does (one sentence is enough)
   - **`entrypoints.api_file`**: The python file that contains your agent entrypoint (e.g. `main.py`)
2. Define your input(s) under `input_schema.inputs`:
   - Add one key per input field (example: `user_query`)
   - Set **`type`**, **`description`**, and **`required`**
   - **`type options`**: `string`, `integer`, `dict`
3. Define your output(s) under `output_schema`:
   - Add one key per output field your agent returns (example: `bot_response`)
   - Set **`type`** and **`description`**
   - **`type options`**: `string`, `integer`, `dict`

Here is the relevant part of the config you will edit:

```json
{
  "agent_name": "Safety Engine Feedback Loop",
  "description": "Upsonic AI Agent that uses the Safety Engine Feedback Loop to ensure the output is compliant with the policy",
  "entrypoints": {
    "api_file": "main.py"
  },
  "input_schema": {
    "inputs": {
      "user_query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "User's input question for the agent",
        "required": true,
        "default": null
      }
    }
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "bot_response": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Agent's generated response"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test in your local with "upsonic run"

1. Run the agent locally:

```bash
uv run upsonic run
```

And then go to http://localhost:8000/docs .

  <Step title="3) Select your agent repository">
    Find and click the agent repository you created (the repo you want to deploy).
  </Step>
  <Step title="4) Configure LLM Connection">
    Set up your **LLM Connection** (provider + credentials) for this deployment.

    ![Screenshot2025 12 18at5 24 47PM](/images/Screenshot2025-12-18at5.24.47PM.png)

### Use your Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="1) Open the deployed agent">
    Go to your agent from the AgentOS dashboard / agents list.
