## What is an MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between Large Language Model (LLM) applications and external data sources and tools. By utilizing MCP, you can enhance your AI agents' capabilities by connecting them to a wide range of tools developed by both companies and the community. This integration allows your agents to perform tasks that require external data access or specialized processing beyond their built-in functionalities.

**What do MCPs do?**
* Execute specific business logic or API calls
* Interact with databases, file systems, or external services
* Perform data processing, calculations, or transformations
* Enable human-in-the-loop workflows with confirmation and input requirements
* Provide caching and performance optimization capabilities

**What are the parts of an MCP?**
* **Server Definition:** The MCP server class that specifies connection details
* **Command Configuration:** The command and arguments to run the MCP server
* **Tool Integration:** Automatic integration with Upsonic's tool processing system
* **Error Handling:** Robust error management for production reliability

## Core Principles For MCPs

When integrating MCP tools into your AI agents, ensure you define these elements:

* **Clear Purpose:** Each MCP should have a single, well-defined responsibility
* **Proper Configuration:** All connection details must be correctly specified
* **Error Handling:** Graceful failure handling with meaningful error messages
* **Security:** Verify the security and reliability of the MCP tool, especially if it involves handling sensitive data

### Defining MCP Server Classes

The MCP server class definition is the foundation of your MCP integration. Follow these guidelines:

* **Single Responsibility:** Each MCP should do one thing well
* **Clear Configuration:** Use descriptive class names and proper command/argument setup
* **Documentation:** Write comprehensive docstrings that explain the MCP's purpose and usage

**Good MCP Definition:**

```python
class DatabaseMCP:
    """
    MCP server for SQLite database operations.
    Provides tools for creating tables, inserting data, and querying databases.
    """
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/path/to/database.db"]
```

**Bad MCP Definition:**

```python
class MCP:
    # Missing documentation and unclear purpose
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["some-server"]
```

## MCP Best Practices

### Security Considerations

Validate and secure your MCP configurations:

```python
class SecureMCP:
    """
    MCP server with security considerations.
    """
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/secure/path/database.db"]
    env = {"SECURE_MODE": "true"}  # Environment variables for security
```

### Clear Documentation

Always provide comprehensive documentation:

```python
class WellDocumentedMCP:
    """
    Clear description of what the MCP does.
    
    This MCP provides filesystem operations including:
    - Reading files
    - Writing files
    - Directory listing
    - File permissions management
    
    Security Note: Only operates within the specified directory.
    """
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["mcp-server-filesystem", "/allowed/directory"]
```

## Let's Create MCP Tools for a Database Management Agent

In this example, we'll create a comprehensive database management system using MCP tools and show how to combine them with regular Upsonic tools.

```python
# Upsonic Docs: Add an MCP
# https://docs.upsonic.ai/guides/5-add-an-mcp

# Imports
import os
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.tools import WebSearch, WebRead
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Set your OpenAI API key (via environment variable or .env file)
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"  # Or use .env file

# MCP 1: SQLite Database Operations
class DatabaseMCP:
    """
    MCP server for SQLite database operations.
    Provides comprehensive database management capabilities.
    """
    command = "uvx"
    args = ["mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "/tmp/library.db"]

# Response Format for Structured Output
class DatabaseReport(BaseModel):
    tables_created: int
    records_inserted: int
    sample_data: str
    summary: str

# Agent Creation with MCP Tools
database_agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-5",
    name="Database Management Expert",
    role="Database operations and data management specialist",
    goal="Provide comprehensive database management with structured reporting"
)

# Example 1: Basic Database Operations
basic_task = Task(
    description="Create a comprehensive library management database. Create a 'books' table with columns: id (integer primary key), title (text), author (text), isbn (text), published_year (integer), and available (boolean). Insert 5 sample books with different authors and years. Then create a 'borrowers' table with columns: id (integer primary key), name (text), email (text), and phone (text). Insert 3 sample borrowers. Finally, show all books and all borrowers in separate queries.",
    tools=[DatabaseMCP]
)

# Execute the basic database operations
result = database_agent.do(basic_task)
print("Basic Database Operations Result:")
print(result)

# Example 2: Structured Output with MCP
structured_task = Task(
    description="Create a 'products' table with id, name, price, and category columns. Insert 5 sample products with different categories. Then provide a structured report including the number of tables created, records inserted, sample data, and a summary of the operations.",
    tools=[DatabaseMCP],
    response_format=DatabaseReport
)

# Execute with structured output
structured_result = database_agent.do(structured_task)
print("\nStructured Database Report:")
print(f"Tables Created: {structured_result.tables_created}")
print(f"Records Inserted: {structured_result.records_inserted}")
print(f"Summary: {structured_result.summary}")

# Example 3: Combined MCP and Regular Tools
research_agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-5",
    name="Research and Database Agent",
    role="Combined research and data management specialist",
    goal="Research topics and store findings in a structured database"
)

combined_task = Task(
    description="Research the top 3 programming languages in 2024. Create a 'languages' table with columns: id, name, popularity_rank, description, and use_cases. Insert the research findings into the database. Then query the database to show all languages sorted by popularity rank.",
    tools=[WebSearch, WebRead, DatabaseMCP]
)

# Execute the combined workflow
combined_result = research_agent.do(combined_task)
print("\nCombined Research and Database Result:")
print(combined_result)

# Example 4: Multiple MCP Workflow
workflow_agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-5",
    name="Multi-MCP Workflow Agent",
    role="Multi-tool specialist",
    goal="Use multiple MCP tools to accomplish complex tasks"
)

workflow_task = Task(
    description="Create a 'companies' table with id, name, industry, and revenue columns. Research 3 tech companies and insert their information into the database. Then create a 'employees' table and insert sample employee data for these companies. Finally, provide a comprehensive report of all data.",
    tools=[WebSearch, WebRead, DatabaseMCP]
)

# Execute the workflow
workflow_result = workflow_agent.do(workflow_task)
print("\nMulti-MCP Workflow Result:")
print(workflow_result)
```

**Need more advanced features?** The MCP integration supports many powerful configuration options including:
