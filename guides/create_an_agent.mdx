## What's an AI Agent?

They are programs that are capable of creating intelligent outputs for any given task. Traditional software is designed for one specific thing and follows a sequential flow. Agents, however, dynamically prepare themselves to perform tasks and determine their own needs and actions. They are like general Machine Learning (ML) models, meaning you can use them for a variety of tasks.


**What do they do?**
- Understand requests
- Classify and extract any kind of data (text, image, audio, and video)
- Make decisions and generate intelligent outputs (as text, image, audio, or other output)
- Connect to other tools and data to complete or assist operations (e.g., making requests to APIs, retrieving data, performing operations)

**What are the parts of an agent?**
- **Characterization:** This is the most important part. Agents are like 1000 different experts, but for any given task, we only need a few of them. For this reason, we characterize them specifically for our tasks.
- **Reasoning:** When agents engage in more extensive thinking, it leads to more accurate answers. Reasoning tools analyze operations, create plans, analyze tool and agent outputs, make revisions, and replan. We offer pre-built reasoning and thinking tools that you can enable in the required agents.
- **Memory:** Just like humans, agents have the ability to store and retrieve information from previous operations. This allows them to customize and specify themselves according to user preferences, providing personalized answers.
- **Knowledge Base:** In many cases, we have a lot of data to improve their answers. Sometimes we want to provide extensive information and then ask for specific parts of it. In such cases, we perform RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and we have special search agents that we call Agentic Search for this feature.
- **Storage:** We provide integrations to local and cloud storage options for storing memories and knowledge bases.
