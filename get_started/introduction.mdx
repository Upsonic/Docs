    Easily complete the tasks you will accomplish and run them in various ways to get results. Focus on the tasks, not the process.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Characterization" icon="user-tie">
    Share your company's URL and objective, then input a job title for the agent. The Upsonic framework will generate a persona and assign tasks accordingly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Support" icon="plug">
    Directly integrate with a comprehensive tool pool developed by the community and companies. Achieve stability with official tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scalable" icon="server">
    The most critical components are internally positioned on the server-side, allowing you to deploy the server via Docker and perform a lightweight integration with your application on the client-side in a stateless manner.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Direct LLM Call" icon="angles-right">
    If the task you want to have done is simple and doesn't require sub-tasks, you don't need to spend time with agents. You can directly make an LLM call and get the results instantly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Object as Response" icon="object-ungroup">
    When working with LLMs, to get more refined results from them, the responses should be programmatic. In this regard, you can define how you want the response by specifying it as class and receiving it as an object.
