description: "Use Upsonic's Sequential Team with two agents to turn raw git log output into a ready-to-post Twitter/X update — Tech Lead summarizes commits, Growth Hacker writes the tweet. No glue code; context flows automatically."
---

This example demonstrates how to use an **Upsonic Team** in **sequential mode** to turn raw `git log --oneline` output into a developer-native Twitter/X post. Two agents run in a pipeline: Agent A distills commits into a technical summary; Agent B turns that summary into a single, post-ready tweet. Context passes from A → B automatically via `mode="sequential"` — no variable passing or glue code.

## Overview

Upsonic framework provides a **Team** abstraction for multi-agent workflows. This example showcases:

1. **Sequential Team** — `mode="sequential"` runs agents in order and injects each agent's output into the next agent's context.
2. **Tech Lead Agent** — Reads raw commit messages, filters out `chore`/`docs`, and produces a concise technical summary of user-facing changes.
3. **Growth Hacker Agent** — Takes the summary and writes a single Twitter/X post with strict tone and format rules (no hashtags, no corporate language, minimal emoji).
4. **No Glue Code** — You don't pass strings or parse outputs between agents; the framework handles context handover.

The pipeline:
- **Input**: A string of `git log --oneline` (mock in script; replace with real `git log` later).
- **Output**: The final tweet from `tasks[-1].response`.

## Project Structure

```
git_changelog_writer/
├── main.py                    # Sequential Team pipeline (agents + tasks)
├── README.md                  # Quick start and notes
```

### Environment Variables

Configure the OpenAI models used by both agents:

```bash
# Required: OpenAI API key (Tech Lead uses gpt-5-mini, Growth Hacker uses gpt-4o)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

Or use a `.env` file in the project root.

## Installation

```bash
# From repo root
uv sync

# Or from this example directory
cd examples/multi_agent/git_changelog_writer
uv sync
```

## Usage

### Run the pipeline

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Or from repo root:

```bash
uv run examples/multi_agent/git_changelog_writer/main.py
```

The script uses mock commit data (`RAW_COMMITS`). To use real git output, replace `RAW_COMMITS` with the result of `git log --oneline -n 5` (or pipe it in).

## How It Works

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tech Lead | Summarizes raw commits; ignores chore/docs; explains what changed and why users care |
| Growth Hacker | Writes a single Twitter/X post from the summary; dev tone, no hashtags, minimal emoji |
| Sequential Team | Runs tasks in order; each task's response becomes context for the next |
| Output | Final tweet from `tasks[-1].response` |

### Example Output

**Agent A (Tech Lead)** produces a technical summary:

```
Summary of User-Facing Changes:

1. New Feature: Dark Mode Support
   - What Changed: The user interface now offers dark mode support.
   - Why Users Care: More comfortable for extended usage and low-light environments.

2. New Feature: Smart Caching Layer
   - What Changed: A smart caching layer was introduced to optimize performance.
   - Why Users Care: Dashboard load times are 3x faster.

3. Bug Fix: Database Connection Timeout
   - What Changed: Resolved a timeout issue under heavy load.
   - Why Users Care: Improved reliability during peak usage.

4. Bug Fix: Real-Time Notifications
   - What Changed: Fixed a race condition affecting notifications.
   - Why Users Care: Notifications are now delivered accurately and timely.
```

**Agent B (Growth Hacker)** turns it into a tweet:

```
Dark mode now available across our UI. 🌙

UI enhancements + performance upgrades with these latest updates.

- 🌙 Dark Mode support
- 🚀 Dashboard 3x speed boost with smart caching
- 🔧 Database timeout fix for heavy loads
- 🛠️ Real-time notifications now more reliable

Changelog: [link]
```

Programmatic access to the final result:

```python
team.print_do(tasks)
print(tasks[-1].response)  # The final tweet
```

## Complete Implementation

### main.py

```python
"""
I Stopped Writing Changelogs. Here's What Writes Them Now.

Two agents, one pipeline: feed in `git log --oneline`, get back
a ready-to-post tweet. Agent A reads the commits and pulls out
what matters. Agent B turns that into something you'd actually post.

The context flows from A → B automatically.
No variable passing. No glue code. Just `mode="sequential"`.

### Two-agent pipeline

- **Tech Lead**: Filters commits, focuses on feat/fix, outputs a structured technical summary.
- **Growth Hacker**: Consumes that summary and applies strict tone/structure rules to produce one tweet.

### Extensibility

You can add more agents (e.g. Editor, Translator) to the `agents` list and add corresponding `Task` entries. Context still flows in order; no extra glue code.

### Cost

Roughly on the order of a few cents per run (Tech Lead on gpt-5-mini, Growth Hacker on gpt-4o). Adjust models in each `Agent()` if you want to trade cost vs. quality.
