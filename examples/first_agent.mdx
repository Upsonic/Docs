## Overview

In this example, we will create a sample agent, and while creating this agent, we will have the opportunity to analyze and learn Upsonic's fundamental mechanisms.

Agents are like electronic employees that perform your tasks for you. Properly positioning them allows you to allocate time for more important and high-value tasks instead of spending time on many time-consuming and low-value-added tasks.

## Basic Agent

```python basic_agent.py
from upsonic import Agent, Task

task = Task("Do an in-depth analysis of US history")

agent = Agent("Historian")

agent.print_do(task)

```

To run the agent set OPENAI\_API\_KEY in your .env file.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup your virtual environment">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac
      python3 -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate

      ```

      ```bash Windows
      python3 -m venv aienv
      aienv/scripts/activate

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Mac
      pip install -U upsonic
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Put your OpenAI key">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript helloWorld.js
      console.log("Hello World");
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the agent to do the task">
    ```bash
    python basic_agent.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent with tools

This agent will read and fetch the latest OpenAI developments from the internet.

```python agent_with_tools.py
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.client.tools import Search # Importing Search Tool

task = Task(
  "Find the latest OpenAI developments on the internet.", 
  tools=[Search] # Adding Search tool to the Task
)

agent = Agent("Reporter")

agent.print_do(task)

```

Run the agent

```bash
python agent_with_tools.py
```

## Agent with Object Response

This agent will do the same thing as the agent above, fetching OpenAI developments, but this time it will bring back the results in a format we desire: a programmable and usable output.

```python agent_with_object_response.py
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.client.tools import Search

from upsonic import ObjectResponse # Importing Object Response

class ANew(ObjectResponse):
  title: str
  content: str
class News(ObjectResponse):
  news: lists[ANew] # We want to get a list of ANew objects

task = Task(
  "Find the latest OpenAI developments on the internet.", 
  tools=[Search],
  response_format=News # Specifying the Response that we want
)

agent = Agent("Reporter")

agent.print_do(task)

```

When you want to use the news:

```python agent_with_object_response.py
result = task.response

for each_new in result.news:
  print()
  print("Title:", each_new.title)
  print("Content:", each_new.content)

```

Run the agent

```bash
python agent_with_object_response.py
```
