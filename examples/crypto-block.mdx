description: "Use Upsonic's Safety Engine with CryptoBlockPolicy to block cryptocurrency-related content."

---

This example demonstrates how to use **Upsonic's Safety Engine** with a prebuilt **CryptoBlockPolicy** to automatically block cryptocurrency-related content in both user inputs and agent outputs.

## Overview

The Safety Engine is a powerful feature in Upsonic that allows you to enforce content policies on your LLM agents. This example showcases:

1. **User Policy** — Blocks cryptocurrency-related queries from users
2. **Agent Policy** — Prevents the agent from discussing or providing crypto-related information

The `CryptoBlockPolicy` is a prebuilt policy that detects and blocks content related to:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Cryptocurrency
- Blockchain
- And other crypto-related terms

## Key Features

- **Prebuilt Policy**: No need to implement blocking logic — Upsonic provides it out of the box
- **Dual Protection**: Policies can be applied to both user inputs and agent outputs
- **Easy Integration**: Just add the policy to your Agent constructor
- **Selective Blocking**: Only blocks crypto-related content, allows all other queries
- **Extensible**: You can combine multiple policies or create custom ones

## Code Structure

### Agent with Safety Policies

```python
crypto_agent = Agent(
    name="Crypto-Sensitive Agent",
    role="Assistant adhering to content policies",
    goal="Provide information while blocking cryptocurrency-related content",
    instructions="Avoid discussing or providing information about cryptocurrencies.",
    user_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy,  # Apply policy to user inputs
    agent_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy  # Apply policy to agent outputs
)
```

### Test Cases

The script includes four test cases:

```python
# Test 1: Direct crypto query (Bitcoin)
crypto_query_1 = Task(
    description="Can you tell me the current price of Bitcoin and the best wallet to use?",
    response_format=str
)

# Test 2: Ethereum query
crypto_query_2 = Task(
    description="What are the benefits of Ethereum smart contracts?",
    response_format=str
)

# Test 3: General crypto question
crypto_query_3 = Task(
    description="Should I invest in cryptocurrency?",
    response_format=str
)

# Test 4: Normal question (should work fine)
normal_query = Task(
    description="What is the capital of France?",
    response_format=str
)
```

## Complete Implementation

```python
# task_examples/crypto_block_policy/crypto_block_policy.py

from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine import CryptoBlockPolicy

# --- Step 1: Create an agent with CryptoBlockPolicy ---
# The CryptoBlockPolicy is a prebuilt policy from Upsonic that blocks cryptocurrency-related content
crypto_agent = Agent(
    name="Crypto-Sensitive Agent",
    role="Assistant adhering to content policies",
    goal="Provide information while blocking cryptocurrency-related content",
    instructions="Avoid discussing or providing information about cryptocurrencies.",
    user_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy,  # Apply policy to user inputs
    agent_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy  # Apply policy to agent outputs
)

```

## How It Works

1. **Policy Definition**: The `CryptoBlockPolicy` is imported from Upsonic's safety engine as a prebuilt policy.
2. **Policy Application**: The policy is applied to both:
   - `user_policy` — Filters incoming user messages
   - `agent_policy` — Filters outgoing agent responses
3. **Automatic Blocking**: When crypto-related content is detected, the Safety Engine automatically blocks it and returns a policy violation message.

## Usage

### Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

### Run the demo

```bash
uv run task_examples/crypto_block_policy/crypto_block_policy.py
