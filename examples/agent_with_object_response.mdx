## Agent with Object Response

This agent will do the same thing as the agent above, fetching OpenAI developments, but this time it will bring back the results in a format we desire: a programmable and usable output.

```python agent_with_object_response.py
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.client.tools import Search

from upsonic import ObjectResponse # Importing Object Response

class ANew(ObjectResponse):
  title: str
  content: str
class News(ObjectResponse):
  news: lists[ANew] # We want to get a list of ANew objects

task = Task(
  "Find the latest OpenAI developments on the internet.", 
  tools=[Search],
  response_format=News # Specifying the Response that we want
)

agent = Agent("Reporter")

agent.print_do(task)

```

When you want to use the news:

```python agent_with_object_response.py
result = task.response

for each_new in result.news:
  print()
  print("Title:", each_new.title)
  print("Content:", each_new.content)

```

Run the agent

```bash
python agent_with_object_response.py
```
