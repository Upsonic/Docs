## Overview

Team enables multiple specialized agents to work together on complex tasks. Teams automatically coordinate work, share context, and combine results through different operational modes.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Sequential, coordinate, or route execution
- **Smart Assignment**: Automatically picks the right agent for each task
- **Context Sharing**: Agents receive context from previous tasks
- **Result Combining**: Combines outputs into coherent final answer
- **Flexible Coordination**: Leader-based planning or expert routing
- **Shared Memory**: Optional memory sharing across team

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
data_analyst = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Data Analyst",
    role="Data Analysis Expert",
    goal="Analyze data and extract insights"
)

report_writer = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Report Writer",
    role="Business Report Specialist",
    goal="Create professional business reports"
)

# Create team with coordination
team = Team(
    agents=[data_analyst, report_writer],
    mode="coordinate",
    model="openai/gpt-4o"  # Required for leader agent
)

# Define tasks
tasks = [
    Task(description="Analyze Q4 sales data and identify trends"),
    Task(description="Create executive summary of findings")
]

# Leader agent coordinates the team
result = team.print_do(tasks)
print(result)
```
