## Overview

Team enables multiple specialized agents to work together on complex tasks. Teams automatically coordinate work, share context, and combine results through different operational modes.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Sequential, coordinate, or route execution
- **Smart Assignment**: Automatically picks the right agent for each task
- **Context Sharing**: Agents receive context from previous tasks
- **Result Combining**: Combines outputs into coherent final answer
- **Flexible Coordination**: Leader-based planning or expert routing
- **Shared Memory**: Optional memory sharing across team

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research specialist"
)

writer = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Writer",
    role="Content writer"
)

# Create team
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    mode="sequential"
)

# Create tasks
tasks = [
    Task("Research latest AI trends"),
    Task("Write a blog post about the research")
]

# Execute team
team.print_do(tasks)
# team.do(tasks)
```
