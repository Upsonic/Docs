## What is Team?

The Team class is a callable class for multi-agent operations using the Upsonic client. It enables you to create teams of specialized AI agents that can work together to accomplish complex tasks that would be difficult for a single agent to handle.

## How Team Works?

Teams handle all the complexity automatically through several key mechanisms:

- **Smart Assignment** - Automatically picks the right agent for each task based on their roles and capabilities
- **Context Sharing** - Agents receive context from previous tasks and can see what other agents have accomplished
- **Result Combining** - Combines all outputs from multiple agents into one coherent final answer
- **Coordination** (in coordinate mode) - A leader agent plans and delegates work strategically
- **Routing** (in route mode) - Intelligent expert selection for specialized queries

You just define your agents and tasks - the team handles the rest.
