## What is a Team?

A `Team` is a coordinated group of specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. Just like human teams, agent teams leverage the unique strengths of each member, dividing work based on expertise and coordinating to achieve a common goal.

Teams in Upsonic automatically manage work distribution, context sharing, and result aggregation. Each agent maintains its own specialization while contributing to the team's collective output.

## Why use Teams?

Teams solve problems that single agents struggle with:

- **Divide complex work**: Break down large problems into manageable sub-tasks
- **Combine expertise**: Leverage different agent specializations (research, writing, analysis, coding, etc.)
- **Improve quality**: Multiple agents review and refine each other's work
- **Sequential workflows**: Chain agents where one's output becomes another's input
- **Parallel processing**: Run multiple agents simultaneously for faster results
- **Scalability**: Add or remove agents based on workload requirements

## Overview

Team enables multiple specialized agents to work together on complex tasks through different operational modes. Teams automatically coordinate work, share context, and combine results to produce coherent final outputs.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Sequential, coordinate, or route execution
- **Smart Assignment**: Automatically picks the right agent for each task
- **Context Sharing**: Agents receive context from previous tasks
- **Result Combining**: Combines outputs into coherent final answer
- **Flexible Coordination**: Leader-based planning or expert routing
- **Shared Memory**: Optional memory sharing across team

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research specialist"
)

writer = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Writer",
    role="Content writer"
)

# Create team
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    mode="sequential"
)

# Create tasks
tasks = [
    Task("Research latest AI trends"),
    Task("Write a blog post about the research")
]

# Execute team
result = team.do(tasks)
print(result)
```
