## What is Sequential Team mode

Sequential mode is the default and most straightforward team operation mode. Tasks flow from one agent to the next automatically, with the team intelligently selecting the best agent for each task based on their roles and capabilities.

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find accurate information and data"
)

writer = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Writer",
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Create clear and engaging content"
)

# Create sequential team
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    mode="sequential"
)

# Define tasks
tasks = [
    Task(description="Research the latest developments in quantum computing"),
    Task(description="Write a blog post about quantum computing for general audience")
]

# Execute team workflow
result = team.do(tasks)
print(result)
```

## Streaming with mixed Agent and Team entities

You can stream output with a mix of Agent and nested Team entities. Each entity's output is preceded by a header (e.g. `--- [Agent] Researcher ---`).

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

researcher = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find accurate information and data",
)

editor = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Editor",
    role="Editor",
    goal="Polish and refine content",
)

writer_team = Team(
    entities=[
        Agent(
            model="openai/gpt-4o",
            name="Writer",
            role="Content Writer",
            goal="Create clear and engaging content",
        ),
        editor,
    ],
    mode="sequential",
    name="WriterTeam",
)

team = Team(
    entities=[researcher, writer_team],
    mode="sequential",
)

tasks = [
    Task(description="Research the latest developments in quantum computing"),
    Task(description="Write a blog post about quantum computing for general audience"),
]

for chunk in team.stream(tasks):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

## Params

- `agents`: List of Agent instances
