## What is The Selection Criteria?

Choose your team mode based on your workflow requirements:

- **Sequential**: For linear workflows where tasks flow from one agent to the next
- **Coordinate**: For complex projects requiring strategic planning and delegation
- **Route**: For routing queries to the best specialist agent

## Use Case for Sequential Mode

Use sequential mode when:
- You have a clear sequence of steps
- Each step needs a different skill
- Tasks build on previous results
- You want simple, automatic collaboration

**Example:** Research → Write → Edit → Publish

## Use Case for Coordinate Mode

Use coordinate mode when:
- Tasks are complex and interconnected
- You need strategic planning
- The workflow isn't linear
- You want a leader making decisions

**Example:** Building a complete software project with architecture, development, testing, and deployment

## Use Case for Route Mode

Use route mode when:
- You have specialized experts
- Each request goes to ONE expert
- You need fast routing decisions
- No multi-step collaboration needed

**Example:** Customer support routing (billing → billing expert, technical → tech support)
