## About Example Scenario

A research workflow that uses Deep Agent to conduct comprehensive analysis with specialized subagents for data analysis, research, and writing.

## Deep Agent Configuration

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Agent, Task

# Create research team
data_analyst = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="data-analyst",
    system_prompt="You are a data analysis and statistics expert"
)

researcher = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="researcher",
    system_prompt="You are a research and information gathering expert"
)

writer = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="writer",
    system_prompt="You are a technical writing and report creation expert"
)

# Create Deep Agent with research team
agent = DeepAgent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    subagents=[data_analyst, researcher, writer]
)
```

## Full Code

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Agent, Task

# Create research team
data_analyst = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="data-analyst",
    system_prompt="You are a data analysis and statistics expert"
)

researcher = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="researcher",
    system_prompt="You are a research and information gathering expert"
)

writer = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="writer",
    system_prompt="You are a technical writing and report creation expert"
)

# Create Deep Agent with research team
agent = DeepAgent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    subagents=[data_analyst, researcher, writer]
)

# Execute comprehensive research project
task = Task("""
Conduct comprehensive market research on AI tools:
- Analyze market trends and competitors
- Gather data on user preferences
- Create detailed report with recommendations
- Include charts and visualizations
""")

result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
```
