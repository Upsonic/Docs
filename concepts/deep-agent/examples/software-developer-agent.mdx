## About Example Scenario

A comprehensive software development workflow using Deep Agent with specialized subagents for different aspects of development (frontend, backend, testing).

## Deep Agent Configuration

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Agent, Task

# Create specialized development team
frontend_dev = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="frontend",
    system_prompt="You are a frontend development expert specializing in React and modern web technologies"
)

backend_dev = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="backend",
    system_prompt="You are a backend development expert specializing in Node.js, Python, and database design"
)

tester = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="tester",
    system_prompt="You are a QA and testing expert focused on automation and comprehensive test coverage"
)

# Create Deep Agent with specialized team
agent = DeepAgent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    subagents=[frontend_dev, backend_dev, tester]
)
```

## Full Code

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Agent, Task

# Create specialized development team
frontend_dev = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="frontend",
    system_prompt="You are a frontend development expert specializing in React and modern web technologies"
)

backend_dev = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="backend",
    system_prompt="You are a backend development expert specializing in Node.js, Python, and database design"
)

tester = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    name="tester",
    system_prompt="You are a QA and testing expert focused on automation and comprehensive test coverage"
)

# Create Deep Agent with specialized team
agent = DeepAgent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    subagents=[frontend_dev, backend_dev, tester]
)

# Execute complex development project
task = Task("""
Build a complete task management application:
- User authentication and authorization
- Task CRUD operations
- Real-time updates
- Mobile-responsive design
- Unit and integration tests
- Deployment configuration
""")

result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
```
