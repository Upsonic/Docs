## About Example Scenario

A simple example demonstrating Deep Agent's core capabilities: automatic todo creation, file management, and completion tracking for building a basic application.

## Deep Agent Configuration

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Task

agent = DeepAgent("openai/gpt-4o")
```

This creates a basic Deep Agent with:
- Default model: GPT-4o
- Auto-created InMemoryStorage-based memory
- Tool call limit: 100
- All default Deep Agent tools enabled

## Full Code

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Task

# Create a Deep Agent
agent = DeepAgent("openai/gpt-4o")

# Complex task that benefits from planning
task = Task("Analyze the codebase and create a comprehensive report with recommendations")
result = agent.do(task)

# The agent will automatically:
# 1. Create a todo list to plan the work
# 2. Use virtual files to organize findings
# 3. Complete all tasks before finishing

print(result)
```
