## Usage

Deep Agent uses the `write_todos` tool to create and manage structured task lists for complex work sessions.

The agent automatically uses this tool when:
- Tasks require 3 or more distinct steps
- Tasks are non-trivial and require careful planning
- User explicitly requests todo list
- User provides multiple tasks
- Future revisions may be needed based on intermediate results

## Params

```python
write_todos(todos: List[Todo]) -> str
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `todos` | `List[Todo]` | Yes | List of Todo objects with 'content' and 'status' fields |

**Return Value:** Confirmation message with the updated todo list.

## Example

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Task

agent = DeepAgent("openai/gpt-4o")
task = Task("""
Create a complete web application with:
- User authentication system
- Product catalog with search
- Shopping cart functionality
- Payment processing
""")

result = agent.do(task)
# Agent creates todos, works through them, and ensures all are completed
```
