## Usage

Deep Agent provides automatic todo tracking and completion enforcement.

Todos follow a strict lifecycle:
1. Created as `"pending"` or `"in_progress"`
2. Marked `"in_progress"` before starting work
3. Marked `"completed"` immediately after finishing
4. Agent continues until ALL todos are `"completed"`

## Params

### Automatic Completion Loop

The agent automatically:
- Checks todo completion after each execution
- Creates continuation tasks for incomplete todos
- Repeats up to 10 iterations (MAX_COMPLETION_ITERATIONS)
- Provides debug output showing progress (completed/total)

### Managing Todos Programmatically

```python
# Get current todos
todos = agent.get_todos()
# Returns: [{"content": "...", "status": "..."}, ...]

# Access state directly
state = agent.deep_agent_state
todos = state.todos  # List[Todo]
```
