## What is Deep Agent?

Deep Agent extends the base Agent with powerful capabilities for handling complex, multi-step tasks that require planning, file management, and task delegation. It provides:

- **Planning and Todo Management** - Break down multi-step objectives into manageable todos with status tracking
- **Virtual Filesystem** - Create, read, edit, and organize files in an isolated filesystem
- **Subagent System** - Spawn specialized agents for focused, isolated work
- **Automatic Completion Loop** - Ensures all todos are completed before finishing (up to 10 iterations)
- **Persistent Memory** - Maintains context and files across complex workflows using InMemoryStorage

## How Deep Agent Works

Deep Agent operates with an automatic completion loop that ensures all tasks are finished:

**Before Each Task:**
1. Sets up todo management tools (write_todos)
2. Initializes virtual filesystem (ls, read_file, write_file, edit_file)
3. Prepares subagent delegation system (task tool)
4. Loads any existing state from DeepAgentState

**During Task Execution:**
1. Agent creates todos for complex tasks using write_todos
2. Works through todos systematically
3. Uses virtual files to organize work
4. Delegates to subagents when beneficial
5. Updates todo status in real-time (pending → in_progress → completed)

**After Task Execution:**
1. Checks if all todos are completed
2. If incomplete, creates continuation tasks automatically
3. Repeats until all work is finished (max 10 iterations)
4. Ensures all deliverables are created
