## Overview

DeepAgent extends the base Agent with advanced capabilities for handling complex, multi-step tasks. It automatically manages todo lists, provides a virtual filesystem, and can spawn subagents for focused work.

## Key Features

- **Planning and Todo Management**: Break down multi-step objectives with automatic status tracking
- **Virtual Filesystem**: Create, read, edit files in an isolated environment
- **Subagent System**: Spawn specialized agents for focused tasks
- **Automatic Completion Loop**: Ensures all todos are completed (up to 10 iterations)
- **Persistent Memory**: Maintains context and files across workflows

## Example

```python
from upsonic import DeepAgent, Task

# Create a deep agent
agent = DeepAgent("openai/gpt-4o")

# Create a complex task
task = Task(
    description="Research Python web frameworks and create a comparison report"
)

# Execute - agent will automatically create todos and manage the workflow
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
```
