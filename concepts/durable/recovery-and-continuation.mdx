description: "Recover from failures and resume executions"
---

## Basic Recovery

```python
from upsonic import Agent
from upsonic.durable import FileDurableStorage

# Create storage
storage = FileDurableStorage("./checkpoints")

# Resume execution
execution_id = "20251027123456-a1b2c3d4"
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")

result = agent.continue_durable(
    durable_execution_id=execution_id,
    storage=storage
)
print(f"Resumed: {result}")
```

## Recovery with Debug Mode

```python
from upsonic import Agent
from upsonic.durable import FileDurableStorage

# Create storage
storage = FileDurableStorage("./checkpoints")
execution_id = "20251027123456-a1b2c3d4"

# Enable debug mode to see recovery details
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o", debug=True)

# This will show:
# - Checkpoint information
# - Failed step details
# - Steps to be executed
# - Recovery progress
result = agent.continue_durable(
    durable_execution_id=execution_id,
    storage=storage,
    debug=True
)
print(f"Recovered: {result}")
```

## Handling Different Failure Scenarios

```python
from upsonic import Agent
from upsonic.durable import DurableExecution, FileDurableStorage

# Create storage
storage = FileDurableStorage("./checkpoints")
execution_id = "20251027123456-a1b2c3d4"

# Check execution status before recovery
durable = DurableExecution(storage=storage, execution_id=execution_id)
exec_info = durable.get_execution_info()

if exec_info:
    status = exec_info.get('status')
    error = exec_info.get('error')

    if status == "failed":
        print(f"Execution failed at step {exec_info['step_index']}")
        print(f"Error: {error}")
        print(f"Retrying step: {exec_info['step_name']}")

        # Retry the failed execution
        agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")
        result = agent.continue_durable(
            durable_execution_id=execution_id,
            storage=storage
        )
        print(result)

    elif status == "paused":
        print("Execution is paused, resuming...")
        agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")
        result = agent.continue_durable(
            durable_execution_id=execution_id,
            storage=storage
        )
        print(result)

    elif status == "completed":
        print("Execution already completed!")
else:
    print(f"No execution found: {execution_id}")
```
