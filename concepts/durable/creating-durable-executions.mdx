## Basic Usage

Durable executions are created by attaching a `DurableExecution` instance to a `Task`. The system automatically handles checkpoint management throughout the execution lifecycle.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.durable import DurableExecution, FileDurableStorage

# Create storage
storage = FileDurableStorage("./checkpoints")

# Create durable execution
durable = DurableExecution(storage=storage)

# Create agent and task
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")
task = Task(
    description="Process customer data and generate report",
    durable_execution=durable
)

# Execute with automatic checkpointing
try:
    result = agent.do(task)
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    # Resume from checkpoint
    result = agent.continue_durable(
        durable_execution_id=task.durable_execution_id,
        storage=storage
    )
    print(result)
```

## Recovery from Failure

```python
from upsonic import Agent
from upsonic.durable import DurableExecution, FileDurableStorage

# Create storage
storage = FileDurableStorage("./checkpoints")

# Resume from a failed execution
execution_id = "20251027123456-a1b2c3d4"

# Create a new agent instance (simulating restart)
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")

# Resume from the checkpoint
result = agent.continue_durable(
    durable_execution_id=execution_id,
    storage=storage
)
print(f"Recovered and completed: {result}")
```
