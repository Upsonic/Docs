Tasks can include image attachments for processing. The framework automatically handles image loading and provides them to the model for analysis.

## Single Image Attachment

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

agent = Agent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

# Task with single image
task = Task(
    description="Describe what you see in the attached image",
    context=["image.png"]
)

agent.print_do(task)
```

## Multiple Image Attachments

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

agent = Agent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

# Task with multiple images
task = Task(
    description="Compare the two attached images and identify similarities and differences",
    context=["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"]
)

agent.print_do(task)
```

## Images with Other Context

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

agent = Agent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

# Task with images and other context
task = Task(
    description="Analyze the attached chart and provide insights based on the market data",
    context=["chart.png", market_data_task],
)

agent.print_do(task)
```

## Supported Image Formats

The framework supports various image formats including:

- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- BMP (.bmp)
- TIFF (.tiff)

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

agent = Agent(model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

# Example with different image formats
task = Task(
    description="Analyze all the attached images",
    context=["photo.jpg", "diagram.png", "chart.tiff"]
)

agent.print_do(task)
```

## Best Practices

- **File Paths**: Use absolute or relative paths that are accessible to your application
- **Image Size**: Consider image file sizes for performance optimization
- **Format Selection**: Choose appropriate formats based on your analysis needs
- **Error Handling**: Handle cases where image files might not be accessible
- **Context Integration**: Combine images with relevant text context for better analysis
