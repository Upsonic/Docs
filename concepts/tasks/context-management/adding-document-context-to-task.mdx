Tasks can include document attachments for processing. The framework automatically handles document loading and provides them to the model for analysis.

## Single Document Attachment

```python
# Task with single document
task = Task(
    description="Summarize the key points from the attached document",
    context=["report.pdf"]
)
```

## Multiple Document Attachments

```python
# Task with multiple documents
task = Task(
    description="Compare the two attached documents and identify key differences",
    context=["document1.pdf", "document2.pdf"]
)
```

## Supported Document Formats

The framework supports various document formats including:

- PDF (.pdf)
- Word Documents (.docx)
- Text Files (.txt)
- Markdown (.md)
- JSON (.json)
- XML (.xml)
- CSV (.csv)
- HTML (.html)
- CSS (.css)
- Python (.py)
- JavaScript (.js)

```python
# Example with different document formats
task = Task(
    description="Analyze all the attached documents",
    context=["report.pdf", "data.csv", "notes.md"]
)
```

## Folder Context

The framework also supports passing folder paths to automatically include all files within a directory:

```python
# Task with folder context - includes all files in the folder recursively
task = Task(
    description="Analyze all documents in the attached folder",
    context=["/path/to/documents/folder"]
)
```

## Best Practices

- **File Paths**: Use absolute or relative paths that are accessible to your application
- **Document Size**: Consider document file sizes for performance optimization
- **Format Selection**: Choose appropriate formats based on your analysis needs
- **Error Handling**: Handle cases where document files might not be accessible
- **Context Integration**: Combine documents with relevant text context for better analysis
- **Tool Integration**: Use specialized document analysis tools when available
- **Folder Organization**: Organize related documents in folders for easier context management
