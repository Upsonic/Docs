Detailed guide on managing and creating tasks within the Upsonic framework.

## Overview

In the Upsonic framework, a `Task` is a specific assignment completed by an `Agent`. Tasks provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, tools, response format, caching options, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities. Tasks within Upsonic can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together through context sharing and task dependencies. Tasks are executed by agents in a single-threaded manner, with each task processed sequentially. The execution flow includes task validation, context processing, tool processing, agent execution, response processing, and caching.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Description**: Define what needs to be done in natural language
- **Tool Integration**: Attach specific tools the agent can use
- **Structured Output**: Define response format using Pydantic models
- **Context Support**: Add files, images, or other tasks as context
- **Caching**: Built-in caching for repeated executions
- **Guardrails**: Validate output before accepting results

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Create agent and task
agent = Agent("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")
task = Task("Calculate the square root of 144")

# Execute task
agent.print_do(task)
# agent.do(task)
```
