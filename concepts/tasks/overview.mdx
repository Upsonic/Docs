## What is a Task?

A `Task` represents a specific assignment or goal that an Agent should accomplish. It's the unit of work that defines *what* needs to be done, along with all the context, tools, and constraints needed to complete it successfully.

Tasks encapsulate everything an agent needs to know: the objective, available tools, expected output format, relevant context (files, images, other tasks), and validation rules.

## Why use Tasks?

Tasks provide structure and control over agent execution:

- **Clear objectives**: Define exactly what needs to be done in natural language
- **Tool provisioning**: Specify which tools the agent can use for this specific task
- **Output validation**: Define expected response format and validate results
- **Context management**: Attach relevant files, images, or other task results
- **Caching & optimization**: Reuse results for identical tasks to save time and costs
- **Collaboration**: Chain tasks together for complex multi-step workflows
- **Safety**: Apply guardrails and validation rules to ensure quality output

## Overview

In the Upsonic framework, tasks provide all necessary details for execution—from simple queries to complex multi-step workflows. Tasks can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together through context sharing and task dependencies. The execution flow includes task validation, context processing, tool processing, agent execution, response processing, and caching.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Description**: Define what needs to be done in natural language
- **Tool Integration**: Attach specific tools the agent can use
- **Structured Output**: Define response format using Pydantic models
- **Context Support**: Add files, images, or other tasks as context
- **Caching**: Built-in caching for repeated executions
- **Guardrails**: Validate output before accepting results

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Create agent and task
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-5")
task = Task("Calculate the square root of 144")

# Execute task
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```
