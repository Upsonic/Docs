# Task-Centric Structure

Detailed guide on managing and creating tasks within the Upsonic framework.

## Overview

In the Upsonic framework, a `Task` is a specific assignment completed by an `Agent`. Tasks provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, tools, response format, caching options, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities. Tasks within Upsonic can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together through context sharing and task dependencies. Tasks are executed by agents in a single-threaded manner, with each task processed sequentially. The execution flow includes task validation, context processing, tool processing, agent execution, response processing, and caching.

## Basic Task Creation

Tasks in Upsonic are created directly in code using the `Task` class constructor. Each task can be customized with specific tools, response formats, caching options, and validation rules to meet your exact requirements.

```python
from upsonic import Task

# Simple task with just a description
task = Task(description="What is the capital of France?")
```
