In Upsonic, you can use the output of one task as context for another task through the `context` parameter. This enables task chaining and complex workflows.

## Basic Task Chaining

```python
# First task
task1 = Task(description="What is 2 + 2?")
result1 = agent.do(task1)

# Second task using context from first task
task2 = Task(
    description="Based on the previous result, what is that number multiplied by 3?",
    context=[task1]
)
result2 = agent.do(task2)
```

## Multiple Context Sources

```python
# Task with multiple context sources
task3 = Task(
    description="Summarize all the previous mathematical results",
    context=[task1, task2, "Additional context: These were all math problems"]
)
result3 = agent.do(task3)
```

## Complex Workflow Example

```python
# Task 1: Data collection
task1 = Task(
    description="Collect data from market research sources",
    tools=[data_collector],
    enable_cache=True
)

# Task 2: Data analysis
task2 = Task(
    description="Analyze the collected market data",
    tools=[data_analyzer],
    context=[task1],
    enable_thinking_tool=True
)

# Task 3: Report generation
task3 = Task(
    description="Generate a comprehensive market report",
    context=[task1, task2],
    response_format=ReportResult
)
```

## Context Types

Tasks can use various types of context:

- **Other Tasks**: Previous task results for chaining
- **Strings**: Direct text context
- **Knowledge Bases**: RAG-enabled knowledge sources
- **Mixed**: Combination of different context types

```python
# Mixed context example
task = Task(
    description="Analyze the data and provide insights",
    context=[
        data_collection_task,  # Previous task
        "Focus on Q4 performance",  # String context
        knowledge_base  # Knowledge base context
    ]
)
```

## Best Practices

- **Logical Flow**: Design task chains with clear logical progression
- **Context Relevance**: Only include context that's relevant to the current task
- **Performance**: Consider caching for expensive context processing
- **Error Handling**: Handle cases where context tasks might fail
- **Documentation**: Clearly document the expected context flow in your workflows
