## Overview

Culture allows you to define how your agents should behave, communicate, and interact. Unlike User Memory (which stores user-specific traits and preferences), Culture defines universal behavioral guidelines of the agent that apply to all interactions.

## Culture vs. User Memory

| Aspect | Culture | User Memory |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Universal, applies to all interactions | User-specific, per-user, per-session |
| **Purpose** | Behavioral guidelines, communication style, principles | User traits, preferences, characteristics |
| **Storage** | No storage required (works standalone) | Requires storage backend |
| **Use Case** | "You are a 5-star hotel receptionist" | "User prefers formal tone, interests in sport" |
| **Example** | Agent behavior and communication style | User's name, expertise, preferences |

## Quick Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.culture import Culture

# Create Culture with description
my_culture = Culture(
    description="You are a 5-star hotel receptionist",
    add_system_prompt=True,  # Add to system prompt (default: True)
    repeat=False,            # Repeat periodically (default: False)
    repeat_interval=5        # Messages between repeats (default: 5)
)

# Create Agent with Culture
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o", culture=my_culture)

# Use the agent - culture guidelines are automatically applied
result = agent.do(Task("Greet me as I arrive at the hotel"))
print(result)
```

The Culture feature automatically:
- Extracts structured guidelines from your description (Tone of Speech, Topics to Avoid, Topics to Help, Things to Pay Attention To)
- Injects culture guidelines into the agent's system prompt
- Optionally repeats culture guidelines periodically during conversations
