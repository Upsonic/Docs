## Overview

Model provider tools are native capabilities provided directly by AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). These tools are executed by the provider's infrastructure rather than the Upsonic framework, offering provider-optimized performance and specialized features.

## Key Characteristics

- **Provider-Executed**: Run on model provider infrastructure, not in your code
- **Native Integration**: Deep integration with model capabilities
- **Specialized Features**: Provider-specific optimizations and configurations
- **Automatic Rate Limiting**: Provider-managed execution and rate limiting
- **Sequential Execution**: Always executed sequentially by the provider

## Differences from Custom Tools

| **Parallelization** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Always Sequential |
| **Caching** | ✅ Configurable | ❌ Provider-Managed |
| **Retries** | ✅ Configurable | ❌ Provider-Managed |
| **Hooks** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not Supported |

## Provider Compatibility

| Tool | OpenAI Responses | Anthropic | Google | Azure OpenAI |

**For Azure OpenAI:**
- ❌ Model provider tools are NOT supported
- ✅ Use custom tools instead with `azure/gpt-5`
