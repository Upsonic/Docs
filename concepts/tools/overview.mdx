## Overview

Tools enable agents to perform actions beyond text generation. They can execute code, search the web, access APIs, and integrate with external systems to accomplish complex tasks.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Tool Types**: Custom, MCP, Model Provider, and Ready-to-Use tools
- **Flexible Configuration**: Control execution behavior, caching, and retries
- **Type Safety**: Automatic schema generation from Python type hints
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple tools simultaneously for better performance

## Example

Create your own tools using Python functions or classes. Perfect for business logic, API integrations, and domain-specific functionality.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.tools import tool

@tool
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """Calculate the final price after applying a discount."""
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)

# Create agent and task
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")
task = Task(
    description="Calculate 20% discount on $100",
    tools=[calculate_discount]
)

# Execute task
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
```
