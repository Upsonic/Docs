## Overview

Tools can be attached at two levels: **Agent** and **Task**. Where you place a tool determines its scope and availability.

## Agent-Level Tools

Tools added to an **agent** are available for **every task** that agent executes.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.tools import tool

@tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search for information."""
    return f"Results for: {query}"

agent = Agent("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")
agent.add_tools(search)  # Agent-level tool

# search is available in both tasks
task1 = Task(description="Search for Python tutorials")
result = agent.print_do(task1)
print("Result:", result)

task2 = Task(description="Search for JavaScript frameworks")
result = agent.print_do(task2)
print("Result:", result)
```

## Task-Level Tools

Tools added to a **task** are **only available for that specific task**. Other tasks executed by the same agent cannot use them.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.tools import tool

@tool
def calculate_tax(amount: float, rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculate tax for given amount."""
    return amount * rate

agent = Agent("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

# calculate_tax is only available for this task
task1 = Task(
    description="Calculate 18% tax on 1000",
    tools=[calculate_tax]
)
result = agent.print_do(task1)
print("Result:", result)

# This task does NOT have access to calculate_tax
task2 = Task(description="What is the capital of France?")
result = agent.print_do(task2)
print("Result:", result)
```

## Combining Both Levels

When an agent has tools and a task also has tools, the task gets access to **both**:

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.tools import tool

@tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search for information."""
    return f"Results for: {query}"

@tool
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize the given text."""
    return f"Summary of: {text}"

# search is available for ALL tasks
agent = Agent("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", tools=[search])

# This task has both: search (from agent) + summarize (task-only)
task1 = Task(
    description="Search for AI news and summarize the results",
    tools=[summarize]
)
result = agent.print_do(task1)
print("Result:", result)

# This task only has search (from agent), NOT summarize
task2 = Task(description="Search for Python tutorials")
result = agent.print_do(task2)
print("Result:", result)
```

## Summary

| Level | Scope | Use When |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Agent** | Available for all tasks the agent runs | The tool is generally useful across many tasks |
| **Task** | Available only for that specific task | The tool is needed for one specific operation |

<Tip>
Use **agent-level tools** for general-purpose tools like search, database access, or utilities. Use **task-level tools** for specialized tools that are only relevant to a specific task — this keeps the LLM focused by not exposing unnecessary tools.
