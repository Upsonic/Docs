## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. It provides a standardized way for AI agents to communicate with external servers and access their capabilities.

## How MCP Works

MCP creates a bridge between your AI agents and external tool servers:

1. **Server Registration**: You configure an MCP server by specifying its connection details
2. **Tool Discovery**: The framework automatically discovers available tools from the server
3. **Tool Execution**: When your agent needs a tool, the framework handles communication with the MCP server
4. **Result Handling**: Results are returned to your agent in a standardized format

## Key Benefits

- **Extensive Ecosystem**: Access thousands of community-developed and official tools
- **No Custom Development**: Use pre-built tools without writing integration code
- **Standardized Protocol**: Consistent interface across different tool providers
- **Live Updates**: Servers can update tools without changing your code
