## Overview

Server-Sent Events (SSE) based servers for remote MCP tool access.

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Task, Agent

# Define SSE-based MCP servers
class FetchMCP:
    url = "https://your-mcp-server.com/sse"

class SearchMCP:
    url = "https://search-mcp-server.com/sse"

# Create task with MCP tools
task = Task(
    description="Search for the latest technology news in Europe using the SearchMCP tool, then use FetchMCP to retrieve the full content of the top 3 articles.",
    tools=[FetchMCP, SearchMCP]
)

# Create agent
agent = Agent(
    name="News Agent",
    model="openai/gpt-5"
)

# Execute
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
```

## Parameters

- `url` (str): The SSE endpoint URL of the MCP server
- `tool_name_prefix` (str): Optional prefix to add to all tool names (prevents collisions)

## Using Tool Name Prefix

Add a `tool_name_prefix` when using multiple SSE-based MCP servers with overlapping tool names:

```python
class FetchMCP:
    url = "https://fetch-mcp.example.com/sse"
    tool_name_prefix = "fetch"  # Tools become: fetch_get_url, etc.

class SearchMCP:
    url = "https://search-mcp.example.com/sse"
    tool_name_prefix = "search"  # Tools become: search_query, etc.
```

## Characteristics

- Remote server access over HTTP
- Real-time event streaming
- Suitable for cloud-hosted MCP servers
- No local installation required
