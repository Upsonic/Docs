## What are Custom Tools?

Custom tools allow you to extend your AI agents with specialized functionality. Whether you need simple utility functions or complex business logic, Upsonic provides multiple approaches to create tools that integrate seamlessly with your agents.

Custom tools are Python functions or classes that you create to give your AI agents specific capabilities. They can:
- Execute business logic and computations
- Integrate with external APIs and services
- Process and transform data
- Interact with databases and file systems
- Implement domain-specific algorithms

## Key Benefits

- **Flexible Creation**: Use functions, classes, or toolkits
- **Type Safety**: Automatic schema generation from type hints
- **Rich Configuration**: Control execution behavior, caching, retries, and more
- **Developer Friendly**: Minimal boilerplate with decorator-based approach
