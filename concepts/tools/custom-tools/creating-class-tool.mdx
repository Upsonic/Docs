## Overview

Class-based tools automatically register all public methods (not starting with `_`) as tools. Simply create a class instance and pass it to your agent or task.

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

class Calculator:
    """A simple calculator class. All public methods become tools."""
    
    def add(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        """
        Add two numbers together.

        Args:
            a: First number
            b: Second number

        Returns:
            The sum of a and b
        """
        return a + b
    
    def multiply(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        """
        Multiply two numbers.

        Args:
            a: First number
            b: Second number

        Returns:
            The product of a and b
        """
        return a * b
    
    def _private_helper(self):
        """This method won't become a tool (starts with _)."""
        pass

# Create task with the class instance
calculator = Calculator()
task = Task(
    description="Calculate 15 + 27 and then multiply the result by 3",
    tools=[calculator]
)

# Create agent
agent = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o", name="Calculator Agent")

# Execute
agent.print_do(task)
```

## Key Points

- **Public methods only**: Methods starting with `_` are ignored
- **Automatic registration**: All public methods become tools automatically
