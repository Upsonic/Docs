Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) enables you to maintain control over agent executions. Pause runs for external processing, recover from errors, or cancel and resume operations as needed.

## Key Concepts

### Run Identification

Every agent execution has a unique `run_id` that enables:
- State persistence across process restarts
- Cross-process resumption with new agent instances
- Tracking and debugging of execution flows

### Continuation Methods

Use `continue_run_async()` to resume paused or errored runs:
- **By `run_id`**: Load state from persistent storage (cross-process safe)
- **By `task`**: Use in-memory context (same-process continuation)

### Important Notes

- HITL continuation (`continue_run_async`) only supports **direct call mode**
- Streaming mode is not supported for continuation
- For cross-process resumption, always use persistent storage (e.g., `SqliteDatabase`)
