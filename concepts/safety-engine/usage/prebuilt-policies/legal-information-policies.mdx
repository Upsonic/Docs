## What is Legal Info Policy?

Legal information policies detect and protect case numbers, legal IDs, court documents, attorney-client privileged information, and other sensitive legal data.

## Why its Important?

Legal information policies are essential for protecting attorney-client privilege, trade secrets, and confidential legal documents. These policies prevent sensitive legal information from being sent to LLMs, which helps maintain legal confidentiality and protects against privilege waivers.

- **Prevents sending legal documents to LLM**: Blocks case numbers, court documents, and attorney-client privileged information from being processed by language models
- **Protects attorney-client privilege**: Ensures confidential legal communications and privileged information are not exposed to third-party LLM providers
- **Maintains legal confidentiality**: Prevents trade secrets, settlement agreements, and sensitive business data from being processed or shared

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies import LegalInfoBlockPolicy

agent = Agent(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    user_policy=LegalInfoBlockPolicy,
    debug=True
)

task = Task("Case number 2024-CV-12345 involves attorney-client privileged information")
result = agent.print_do(task)
```
