## What is Crypto Policy?

Cryptocurrency policies detect and handle crypto-related content. Designed for financial institutions that need to block or control cryptocurrency discussions, trading advice, or wallet addresses.

## Why its Important?

Cryptocurrency policies are critical for financial institutions and organizations that need to control or restrict cryptocurrency-related discussions. These policies prevent investment advice from being generated, protect against regulatory violations, and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

- **Prevents sending financial data to LLM**: Blocks cryptocurrency-related information from being processed, protecting sensitive financial data
- **Prevents unauthorized investment advice**: Stops AI agents from providing cryptocurrency trading or investment recommendations that could lead to legal issues
- **Ensures regulatory compliance**: Helps financial institutions comply with regulations that restrict cryptocurrency discussions or advice

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies import CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Finder

CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Finder.rule.text_finder_llm = "openai/gpt-4o"

# Block any crypto-related questions
agent = Agent(
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    user_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Finder,
    debug=True
)

task = Task("Tell me about Bitcoin investments")
result = agent.print_do(task)
print("Result:", result)
# Blocked before processing
```
