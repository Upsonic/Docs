## What is Crypto Policy?

Cryptocurrency policies detect and handle crypto-related content. Designed for financial institutions that need to block or control cryptocurrency discussions, trading advice, or wallet addresses.

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies import CryptoBlockPolicy

# Block any crypto-related questions
agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    user_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy
)

task = Task("Tell me about Bitcoin investments")
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
# Blocked before processing
```

## Available Variants

- `CryptoBlockPolicy`: Static keyword detection with blocking
- `CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Block`: Static detection with LLM-generated block messages
- `CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Finder`: LLM-powered detection for better accuracy
- `CryptoReplace`: Replaces crypto keywords with placeholder text
- `CryptoRaiseExceptionPolicy`: Raises DisallowedOperation exception
- `CryptoRaiseExceptionPolicy_LLM_Raise`: LLM-generated exception messages

## Params

When creating custom crypto policies, you can pass options:

```python
from upsonic.safety_engine.base import Policy
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies.crypto_policies import CryptoRule, CryptoBlockAction

custom_rule = CryptoRule(options={
    "keywords": ["NFT", "DeFi", "Web3", "token", "staking"]
})

policy = Policy(
    name="Extended Crypto Policy",
    description="Extra Web3 keywords included",
    rule=custom_rule,
    action=CryptoBlockAction()
)
```
