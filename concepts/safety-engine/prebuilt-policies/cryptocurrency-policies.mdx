## What is Crypto Policy?

Cryptocurrency policies detect and handle crypto-related content. Designed for financial institutions that need to block or control cryptocurrency discussions, trading advice, or wallet addresses.

## Why its Important?

Cryptocurrency policies are critical for financial institutions and organizations that need to control or restrict cryptocurrency-related discussions. These policies prevent investment advice from being generated, protect against regulatory violations, and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

- **Prevents sending financial data to LLM**: Blocks cryptocurrency-related information from being processed, protecting sensitive financial data
- **Prevents unauthorized investment advice**: Stops AI agents from providing cryptocurrency trading or investment recommendations that could lead to legal issues
- **Ensures regulatory compliance**: Helps financial institutions comply with regulations that restrict cryptocurrency discussions or advice

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies import CryptoBlockPolicy

# Block any crypto-related questions
agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    user_policy=CryptoBlockPolicy,
    debug=True
)

task = Task("Tell me about Bitcoin investments")
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
# Blocked before processing
```

## Available Variants

- `CryptoBlockPolicy`: Static keyword detection with blocking
- `CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Block`: Static detection with LLM-generated block messages
- `CryptoBlockPolicy_LLM_Finder`: LLM-powered detection for better accuracy
- `CryptoReplace`: Replaces crypto keywords with placeholder text
- `CryptoRaiseExceptionPolicy`: Raises DisallowedOperation exception
- `CryptoRaiseExceptionPolicy_LLM_Raise`: LLM-generated exception messages

## Params

When creating custom crypto policies, you can pass options:

```python
from upsonic.safety_engine.base import Policy
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies.crypto_policies import CryptoRule, CryptoBlockAction

custom_rule = CryptoRule(options={
    "keywords": ["NFT", "DeFi", "Web3", "token", "staking"]
})

policy = Policy(
    name="Extended Crypto Policy",
    description="Extra Web3 keywords included",
    rule=custom_rule,
    action=CryptoBlockAction()
)
```
