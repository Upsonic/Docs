## What is Phone Number Policy?

Phone number policies specifically detect and anonymize phone numbers in various formats (US, international, etc.).

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies import AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy

# Anonymize just phone numbers in agent output
agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    agent_policy=AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy,  # This policy anonymizes phone numbers in agent responses
)

task = Task("My Number is: +1-555-123-4567. Tell me what is my number.")
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
# Expected: Phone number in agent response should be anonymized (e.g., "+X-XXX-XXX-XXXX" format with random digits)
```

## Available Variants

- `AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy`: Pattern-based detection and anonymization
- `AnonymizePhoneNumbersPolicy_LLM_Finder`: LLM-powered detection for better accuracy

## Params

No custom parameters. Uses built-in phone number patterns.
