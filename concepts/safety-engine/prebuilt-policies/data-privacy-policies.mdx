## What is Data Privacy Policy?

Data privacy policies detect user tracking, cookie data, privacy violations, consent issues, and data retention concerns for GDPR and privacy compliance.

## Why its Important?

Data privacy policies are crucial for ensuring GDPR compliance and protecting user privacy when using AI agents. These policies prevent personal data, tracking information, and privacy-sensitive content from being sent to LLMs, which helps maintain compliance with data protection regulations.

- **Prevents sending personal data to LLM**: Blocks personal information, tracking data, and privacy-sensitive content from being processed by language models
- **Ensures GDPR compliance**: Helps maintain compliance with General Data Protection Regulation and other data protection laws
- **Protects user privacy**: Prevents unauthorized processing or sharing of personal data through AI interactions

## Usage

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.safety_engine.policies import DataPrivacyReplacePolicy

agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    user_policy=DataPrivacyReplacePolicy,
    debug=True
)

task = Task("I want to collect personal data from users without consent")
result = agent.do(task)
# Sensitive content replaced with placeholder
```
