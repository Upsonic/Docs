# Overview

The Upsonic framework provides a configurable AgentConfiguration to complete tasks. Configuring agents means setting them up in a structure where they think as if they're working in a company and stay focused on tasks. Additionally, it automatically configures the agent's decision points and objectives according to their job title.

AgentConfigurations are designed in a reusable structure. For example, in server analysis, you can deploy a software engineer agent and framework can select it to an task, thereby improving the overall system's performance.

## Creating an Agent

The AgentConfiguration class is crucial for efficient task execution. Therefore, time should be devoted to configuring this class, and tests should be conducted with different configurations.

```python
from upsonic import AgentConfiguration

product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    job_title="Product Manager",
    company_url="https://upsonic.ai",
    company_objective="Developing an AI Agent Framework",
)
```

## Agent Attributest

Agents have certain additional features to help or increase success while completing tasks. These can be directly and easily adjusted to expand the agent's capacity during the task process, which will improve the likelihood of completing the work you want the agent to do.

| Attribute                       | Parameters          | Type      | Description                                                 |

| Compress Context *(Optional)*   | `compress_context`  | `boolean` | Compress the context for LLM context lenght (Default: True) |

## Act like an Human

While performing certain tasks, due to the nature of LLM, the agent leaves some parts blank for humans to fill in. If you provide the LLM with a name and contact information, it will write complete texts as the given human user in tasks like writing emails.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Without Human Acting">
    Here, we will create an agent who will be the marketing manager of the Upsonic company. Then, we will assign this agent an email writing task.

    ```python Agent


    # Generating Task and Agent
    task1 = Task(description="Write an outreach mail", tools=[Search])

    product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
        job_title="Marketing Manager",
        company_url="https://upsonic.ai",
        company_objective="To build AI Agent framework that helps people get things done",
    )


    # Run and see the result
    client.agent(product_manager_agent, task1)

    result = task1.response

    print(result)
    ```

    And in the results section, we will see that the agent has left some parts empty for us to fill in, as if we were in a chat screen.

    ```markdown Result
    My name is [Your Name], and I’m a [Your Position] at [Your Company]. I wanted to reach out to introduce [Company Name], a trusted partner in delivering innovative, reliable, and customer-focused technology solutions tailored to your business needs.  

    ****** MAIL Body

    Thank you for considering this opportunity. I genuinely look forward to the possibility of working together and supporting your organization in achieving success.  

    Warm regards,  
    [Your Full Name]  
    [Your Job Title]  
    [Your Company Name]  
    [Your Contact Information]  

    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="With Human Acting">
    Now, we will enter a name and contact information for the agent, and as a result, it will not leave such empty spaces.

    ```python New Agent

    task1 = Task(description="Write an outreach mail", tools=[Search])

    product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
        job_title="Marketing Manager",
        company_url="https://upsonic.ai",
        company_objective="To build AI Agent framework that helps people get things done",
     
        name="Onur ULUSOY",       # Now we have name and contact
        contact="onur@upsonic.co"
    )

    # Run and see the result
    client.agent(product_manager_agent, task1)

    result = task1.response

    print(result)
    ```

    ```markdown New Result

    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Memory

Memory is particularly important for agents that need to maintain a common context across different tasks at different times. The memory here is directly saved to disk and stored according to the agent's ID. If you want to provide memory, you need to define the ID yourself and maintain it across all agent definitions. This way, a persistent memory will be provided.

```python

agent_id = "product_manager_agent" # Setting an agent id

product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    agent_id_=agent_id, # Setting agent id
    memory=True, # Enabling the memory
    
    job_title="Marketing Manager",
    company_url="https://upsonic.ai",
    company_objective="To build AI Agent framework that helps people get things done"
)
```
