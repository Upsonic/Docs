Interfaces enable exposing Upsonic agents through various communication protocols and platforms. Each interface provides a standardized way to connect Upsonic agents to external systems, messaging platforms, and frontend applications.

## Available Interfaces

  <Card title="WhatsApp" icon="whatsapp" href="/concepts/interfaces/whatsapp">

    Serve agents via WhatsApp for direct messaging interactions

  </Card>

## How Interfaces Work

Interfaces are FastAPI routers that mount protocol-specific endpoints on an InterfaceManager instance. Each interface:

* Wraps Upsonic agents into protocol-compatible endpoints

* Handles authentication and request validation for the target platform

* Manages session tracking and context preservation

* Streams responses back to clients in the appropriate format

## Using Interfaces

Interfaces are added to an InterfaceManager instance through the `interfaces` parameter:

```python
from upsonic import Agent
from upsonic.interfaces import InterfaceManager, SlackInterface

agent = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")

manager = InterfaceManager(
    interfaces=[SlackInterface(agent=agent)],
)

manager.serve(port=8000)
```

Multiple interfaces can be added to a single InterfaceManager instance, allowing the same agents to be exposed through different protocols simultaneously.
