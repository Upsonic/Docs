---

The `ReliabilityEvaluator` is a post-execution assertion engine that verifies an agent's tool-calling behavior. It checks whether the expected tools were invoked, in the correct order if required, and flags any unexpected tool calls.

## How It Works

1. Run your agent, team, or graph to completion.
2. Pass the completed result (a `Task`, `List[Task]`, or `Graph`) to the evaluator.
3. The evaluator extracts tool call history and compares it against the expected list.
4. Returns a structured result with pass/fail status, per-tool checks, and missing/unexpected lists.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `expected_tool_calls` | `List[str]` | Yes | Tool names that should have been called |
| `order_matters` | `bool` | No | Whether call order must match (default: `False`) |
| `exact_match` | `bool` | No | Whether only expected tools may be called (default: `False`) |

## Input Types

The `run()` method accepts:

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `Task` | Result of `Agent.do()` / `Agent.do_async()` |
| `List[Task]` | Result of `Team.multi_agent_async()` |
| `Graph` | A Graph instance after `graph.run()` / `graph.run_async()` |

## Result Structure

`ReliabilityEvaluationResult` contains:

- **`passed`** — Overall pass/fail boolean
- **`summary`** — Human-readable explanation
- **`expected_tool_calls`** — The original expected list
- **`actual_tool_calls`** — Ordered list of tools actually called
- **`checks`** — List of `ToolCallCheck` objects (one per expected tool)
- **`missing_tool_calls`** — Expected tools that were not invoked
- **`unexpected_tool_calls`** — Tools called but not expected (only when `exact_match=True`)

Each `ToolCallCheck` includes:

- **`tool_name`** — Name of the tool
- **`was_called`** — Whether the tool was found in history
- **`times_called`** — How many times it was invoked
