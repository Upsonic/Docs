Build a working autonomous agent in just a few lines of code. The `AutonomousAgent` comes pre-configured with filesystem and shell tools, automatic storage, and workspace sandboxing.

## Basic Example

```python
from upsonic import AutonomousAgent, Task

# Create an autonomous agent with workspace
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    workspace="/path/to/project"
)

# The agent can read, write, and execute in the workspace
task = Task("Read the main.py file and explain what it does")
agent.print_do(task)
```

<Warning>
All file and shell operations are restricted to the workspace directory. Attempting to access files outside the workspace will be blocked for security.
</Warning>

## What's Included by Default

When you create an `AutonomousAgent`, you get:

- **InMemoryStorage** as the default storage backend
- **Full session memory** enabled for conversation history persistence
- **Filesystem toolkit** for file operations (read, write, edit, search, etc.)
- **Shell toolkit** for terminal command execution
- **Workspace sandboxing** for security
