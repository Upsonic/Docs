![Autonomous Agent](/images/autonomous-agent.png)

Build powerful autonomous agents that can read, write, and execute code in your workspace.

The `AutonomousAgent` class extends the base `Agent` with built-in filesystem and shell tools, automatic storage setup, and workspace sandboxing. It's the ideal choice for coding assistants, DevOps automation, and any task requiring file or terminal access.

## Overview

`AutonomousAgent` inherits from `Agent` and comes pre-configured with:
- **Default InMemoryStorage**: Automatic session storage without any configuration
- **Full Session Memory Enabled**: Conversation history is preserved by default
- **Filesystem Toolkit** for file operations (read, write, edit, search, etc.)
- **Shell Toolkit** for terminal command execution
- **Workspace Sandboxing** for security

## Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Built-in System Prompt**: Automatically configured with tool usage guidelines
- **Filesystem Tools**: Read, write, edit, search, list, move, copy, delete files
- **Shell Commands**: Execute terminal commands with timeout and output capture
- **Workspace Security**: All operations sandboxed to the workspace directory
- **Read-Before-Edit**: Enforces reading files before editing for safety
- **Inherits All Agent Features**: Memory, policies, streaming, caching, and more

## Quick Example

```python
from upsonic import AutonomousAgent, Task

# Create an autonomous agent with workspace
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    workspace="/path/to/project"
)

# The agent can read, write, and execute in the workspace
task = Task("Read the main.py file and explain what it does")
agent.print_do(task)
```

<Warning>
All file and shell operations are restricted to the workspace directory. Attempting to access files outside the workspace will be blocked for security.
</Warning>
