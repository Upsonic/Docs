The AGENTS.md feature allows you to configure your AutonomousAgent using a markdown file stored in the workspace directory. When a workspace is set, the agent reads the `AGENTS.md` file and includes it in the system prompt, providing persistent configuration and behavioral guidelines.

## Overview

When you set a `workspace` path on an AutonomousAgent:

1. **Configuration Loading**: The agent reads the `AGENTS.md` file from the workspace folder and includes it in the system prompt
2. **Session Greeting**: You can call `execute_workspace_greeting()` to generate a personalized greeting based on the configuration

## Example

```python
from upsonic import AutonomousAgent, Task

# Create an autonomous agent with workspace
agent = AutonomousAgent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    workspace="/path/to/project",
    session_id="user_session_001"
)

# Execute the workspace greeting (optional, for new sessions)
greeting = agent.execute_workspace_greeting()
print(greeting)

# Run tasks - the AGENTS.md content is included in the system prompt
task = Task("What can you help me with?")
agent.print_do(task)
```

## The AGENTS.md File

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your workspace folder to define agent configuration:

```markdown
# DevOps Assistant

default_model: openai/gpt-4o
name: DevOps Agent
description: An autonomous agent for managing project infrastructure and code quality

## Capabilities
- Read and analyze project files
- Run shell commands for testing and deployment
- Create and modify configuration files
- Search codebase for patterns and issues

## Guidelines
- Always read files before editing them
- Run tests after making changes
- Follow the project's existing code style
- Never execute destructive commands without confirmation
```

The content of this file is automatically injected into the agent's system prompt wrapped in `<AgentConfiguration>` tags.

## How It Works

When the AutonomousAgent initializes with a workspace:

1. It checks if an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the workspace directory
2. If found, the file content is read and appended to the system prompt
3. The agent uses these instructions alongside its built-in filesystem and shell tool guidelines
4. The greeting method can introduce the agent based on its configuration

## Integration with Interfaces

When using Upsonic [interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/Overview) (Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp), the workspace greeting is automatically called when a user resets their session with the `/reset` command. The greeting response is sent to the user, providing a fresh start with a personalized introduction.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include clear descriptions of the agent's capabilities and limitations
2. **Define Guidelines**: Set explicit rules for how the agent should behave in the workspace
3. **Project Context**: Describe the project structure and conventions so the agent can follow them
4. **Safety Rules**: Add any safety constraints specific to your project (e.g., "never delete the database")
5. **Session Management**: Use unique `session_id` values for each user or conversation
6. **Greeting Once**: The greeting only executes once per agent instance (tracked by `_workspace_greeting_executed`)
