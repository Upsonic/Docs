## Overview

Direct is a simplified interface for LLM interactions without the overhead of agents. It provides fast, direct communication with language models for scenarios where you don't need memory management or tool orchestration.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Eliminates agent overhead for maximum speed
- **Structured Outputs**: Built-in support for Pydantic models
- **Document Processing**: Native support for PDFs and images
- **Fluent Interface**: Easy configuration switching
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support
- **Simple API**: Minimal configuration required

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Direct, Task
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Create Direct instance
direct = Direct(model="openai/gpt-4o")

# Define structured output
class Response(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    confidence: float

# Create and execute task
task = Task(
    description="What is 2 + 2? Provide confidence.",
    response_format=Response
)

result = direct.do(task)
print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
```
