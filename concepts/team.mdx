## Overview

LLMs excel at characterization. That’s why we use agents and continually refine their system prompts. This also creates new opportunities for agent teams: since our tasks are split among specialized agents, we must manage the process ourselves—assigning each task to the right agent and enabling effective collaboration.

In Upsonic, we have a `Team` class for this purpose. It automatically performs these operations.

## Creating an Team

The `Team` class is a backend component that incorporates multiple automated systems. It facilitates matching and executing the right tasks with the appropriate agents and enables active collaboration.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Team

coder_agent = Agent("Coder")
marketing_agent = Agent("Marketig Manager")

team = Team(
	agents=[coder_agent, marketing_agent]
)
```

## Running Tasks

After instantiating the `Team` class, you can easily run tasks on it—just as you would with the `Agent` and `Direct` classes—by using the `do` and `print_do` functions.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Team, Task

coder_agent = Agent("Coder")
marketing_agent = Agent("Marketig Manager")


team = Team(
	agents=[coder_agent, marketing_agent]
)

task = Task("Write an example python hello world code")
task2 = Task("What is the best strategy to design our go to market")



result = team.print_do(task, task2)

print("Summerized result")
print(result)
```
