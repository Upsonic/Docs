## Overview

LLMs excel at characterization. That’s why we use agents and continually refine their system prompts. This also creates new opportunities for agent teams: since our tasks are split among specialized agents, we must manage the process ourselves—assigning each task to the right agent and enabling effective collaboration.

In Upsonic, we have a `Team` class for this purpose. It automatically performs these operations.

## Creating an Team, Agents and Tasks

The `Team` class is a backend component that incorporates multiple automated systems. It facilitates matching and executing the right tasks with the appropriate agents and enables active collaboration.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# My Agents
travel_agent = Agent(name="My Travel Agent")
history_agent = Agent(name="My History Agent")

# My Tasks
task = Task("Generate a plan to visit cities in Canada")
task2 = Task("Write historical information about the cities")

# My team 
team = Team(
	agents=[travel_agent, history_agent], # Adding Agents
	tasks=[task, task2] # Adding Tasks
)
```

## Getting Final Answer

After instantiating the `Team` class, you can easily run tasks on it—just as you would with the `Agent` and `Direct` classes—by using the `do` and `print_do` functions.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# My Agents
travel_agent = Agent(name="My Travel Agent")
history_agent = Agent(name="My History Agent")

# My Tasks
task = Task("Generate a plan to visit cities in Canada")
task2 = Task("Write historical information about the cities")

# My team 
team = Team(
	agents=[travel_agent, history_agent], # Adding Agents
	tasks=[task, task2] # Adding Tasks
)



# Run the task and get the answer
result = team.complete() 

print("Summerized result")
print(result)
```

## Adding Response Format to The Team

Teams are well but sometimes we need some specific answers from them. To do that you can use `response format` params and a `BaseModel`.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team
from pydantic import BaseModel

# My Agents
travel_agent = Agent(name="My Travel Agent")
history_agent = Agent(name="My History Agent")

# My Tasks
task = Task("Generate a plan to visit cities in Canada")
task2 = Task("Write historical information about the cities")

# Response Format
class City(BaseModel):
	name: str
	history: str
class TravelGuide(BaseModel):
	cities: list[City]

# My team 
team = Team(
	agents=[travel_agent, history_agent], # Adding Agents
	tasks=[task, task2], # Adding Tasks,
	response_format=TravelGuide # Adding Response Format
)



# Run the task and get the answer
result = team.complete() 

print("Summerized result")
print(result)
```
