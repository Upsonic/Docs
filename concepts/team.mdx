## Overview

Complex tasks often need multiple skills. Instead of building one super-agent that does everything, create a team where each agent is an expert at one thing:

- **Better Results** - Specialists outperform generalists
- **Clear Roles** - Each agent has a defined responsibility
- **Natural Workflow** - Tasks flow from one expert to the next
- **Easy to Scale** - Add more specialists as needed

## Three Ways to Collaborate

Choose how your team works together:

| Mode           | How It Works                                      | When to Use                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **sequential** | Tasks go from one agent to the next automatically | Workflows, pipelines, step-by-step processes   |
| **coordinate** | A leader agent plans and delegates to team members | Complex projects, strategic work               |
| **route**      | A router picks the best expert for the job        | Routing queries to specialists                 |

Start with **sequential** mode - it's the simplest and works great for most use cases.

## What's Inside a Team?

Teams handle all the complexity automatically:

- **Smart Assignment** - Picks the right agent for each task
- **Context Sharing** - Agents see what previous agents did
- **Result Combining** - Combines all outputs into one final answer
- **Coordination** (in coordinate mode) - A leader plans and delegates
- **Routing** (in route mode) - Intelligent expert selection

You just define your agents and tasks - the team handles the rest.

## Quick Start

### Your First Team

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find accurate information and data"
)

writer = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Writer",
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Create clear and engaging content"
)

# Create team
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    mode="sequential"
)

# Define tasks
tasks = [
    Task(description="Research the latest developments in quantum computing"),
    Task(description="Write a blog post about quantum computing for general audience")
]

# Execute team workflow
result = team.do(tasks)
print(result)
```

### Adding a Leader (Coordinate Mode)

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
data_analyst = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Data Analyst",
    role="Data Analysis Expert",
    goal="Analyze data and extract insights",
    tools=[analyze_data, create_chart]
)

report_writer = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Report Writer",
    role="Business Report Specialist",
    goal="Create professional business reports"
)

# Create team with coordination
team = Team(
    agents=[data_analyst, report_writer],
    mode="coordinate",
    model="openai/gpt-4o"  # Required for leader agent
)

# Define tasks
tasks = [
    Task(
        description="Analyze Q4 sales data and identify trends",
        tools=[analyze_data, create_chart]
    ),
    Task(
        description="Create executive summary of findings"
    )
]

# Leader agent coordinates the team
result = team.do(tasks)
print(result)
```

### Routing to Experts

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create domain specialists
legal_expert = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Legal Expert",
    role="Legal Advisor",
    goal="Provide legal guidance and compliance information",
    system_prompt="You are an expert in corporate law and regulations"
)

tech_expert = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Tech Expert",
    role="Technology Specialist",
    goal="Provide technical solutions and architecture advice",
    system_prompt="You are an expert in software architecture and cloud systems"
)

financial_expert = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Financial Expert",
    role="Financial Advisor",
    goal="Provide financial analysis and investment guidance",
    system_prompt="You are an expert in financial planning and investment strategies"
)

# Create routing team
team = Team(
    agents=[legal_expert, tech_expert, financial_expert],
    mode="route",
    model="openai/gpt-4o"  # Required for router agent
)

# Router selects best expert
tasks = [
    Task(description="What are the best practices for implementing OAuth 2.0 in a microservices architecture?")
]

result = team.do(tasks)  # Automatically routed to tech_expert
print(result)
```

## Sequential Mode (Recommended)

Tasks flow from one agent to the next. The team automatically picks the best agent for each task.

### Creating a Workflow

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Create specialized agents
research_agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Conduct thorough research and fact-checking"
)

analysis_agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Analyst",
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze information and identify patterns"
)

summary_agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Summarizer",
    role="Content Summarizer",
    goal="Create concise summaries of complex information"
)

# Create sequential team
team = Team(
    agents=[research_agent, analysis_agent, summary_agent],
    mode="sequential"
)

# Multi-step workflow
tasks = [
    Task(description="Research current AI trends in healthcare"),
    Task(description="Analyze the impact of AI on patient outcomes"),
    Task(description="Summarize key findings in bullet points")
]

result = team.do(tasks)
```

### Assigning Specific Agents

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

writer = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o", name="Writer")
editor = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o", name="Editor")

team = Team(agents=[writer, editor], mode="sequential")

# Explicitly assign agents to tasks
task1 = Task(description="Write a product description")
task1.agent = writer  # Force this task to use writer

task2 = Task(description="Edit and polish the description")
task2.agent = editor  # Force this task to use editor

result = team.do([task1, task2])
```

### Automatic Context Passing

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

# Agents automatically receive context from previous tasks
data_fetcher = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Data Fetcher",
    tools=[fetch_user_data]
)

processor = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Processor"
)

team = Team(agents=[data_fetcher, processor], mode="sequential")

tasks = [
    Task(
        description="Fetch user profile for user_id: 12345",
        tools=[fetch_user_data]
    ),
    Task(
        description="Analyze the user's purchase history and create recommendations"
        # This task automatically receives results from previous task as context
    )
]

result = team.do(tasks)
```

## Coordinate Mode (Advanced)

A leader agent takes charge, analyzes all tasks, creates a plan, and delegates work strategically. Great for complex projects.

### Setting Up a Leader

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team
from upsonic.storage import Memory, InMemoryStorage

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Researcher",
    role="Information Gatherer",
    goal="Find comprehensive and accurate information"
)

analyst = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Analyst",
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Extract insights and identify patterns"
)

writer = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="Writer",
    role="Report Writer",
    goal="Create professional reports"
)

# Create team with coordination
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    mode="coordinate",
    model="openai/gpt-4o"
)

# Leader agent will strategically delegate these tasks
tasks = [
    Task(description="Research market trends for electric vehicles"),
    Task(description="Analyze competitive landscape"),
    Task(description="Write market entry strategy report")
]

result = team.do(tasks)
```

### Coordination with Shared Memory

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team
from upsonic.storage import Memory, SqliteStorage

# Create persistent storage for team memory
storage = SqliteStorage(
    sessions_table_name="team_sessions",
    profiles_table_name="team_profiles",
    db_file="./team_memory.db"
)

# Create shared memory
team_memory = Memory(
    storage=storage,
    session_id="project_alpha_session",
    full_session_memory=True
)

# Create team with shared memory
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    mode="coordinate",
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    memory=team_memory  # All agents share this memory during coordination
)

tasks = [
    Task(description="Research competitors"),
    Task(description="Analyze our competitive advantages"),
    Task(description="Create competitive positioning strategy")
]

result = team.do(tasks)
# All delegation conversations are preserved in shared memory
```

### Leader Delegates Tools

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task, Team

def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information"""
    # Implementation
    return f"Search results for: {query}"

def analyze_data(data: dict) -> dict:
    """Analyze data and return insights"""
    # Implementation
    return {"insights": "Key findings..."}

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o", name="Researcher")
analyst = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o", name="Analyst")

# Create team
team = Team(
    agents=[researcher, analyst],
    mode="coordinate",
    model="openai/gpt-4o"
)

# Tasks with tools - leader delegates with appropriate tools
tasks = [
    Task(
        description="Search for recent AI breakthroughs",
        tools=[search_web]
    ),
    Task(
        description="Analyze the impact of these breakthroughs",
        tools=[analyze_data]
    )
]

result = team.do(tasks)
# Leader intelligently assigns tools to the right agents
```

## Route Mode (Expert Selection)

Perfect when you have specialists and need to route each request to the right expert quickly.

)

# Create routing team
team = Team(
    agents=[medical_expert, fitness_expert],
    mode="route",
    model="openai/gpt-4o"
)

# Multiple related tasks routed to single best expert
tasks = [
    Task(description="What are the benefits of regular exercise?"),
    Task(description="Create a beginner workout plan for weight loss"),

## Which Mode Should I Use?

### Choose Sequential When...

✅ You have a clear sequence of steps  
✅ Each step needs a different skill  
✅ Tasks build on previous results  
✅ You want simple, automatic collaboration  

**Example:** Research → Write → Edit → Publish

### Choose Coordinate When...

✅ Tasks are complex and interconnected  
✅ You need strategic planning  
✅ The workflow isn't linear  
✅ You want a leader making decisions  

**Example:** Building a complete software project with architecture, development, testing, and deployment

### Choose Route When...

✅ You have specialized experts  
✅ Each request goes to ONE expert  
✅ You need fast routing decisions  
✅ No multi-step collaboration needed  

**Example:** Customer support routing (billing → billing expert, technical → tech support)

## Tips and Best Practices

### Designing Your Team

**Give Agents Clear Roles**
- Each agent should be an expert at ONE thing
- Write specific role descriptions
- Avoid overlapping responsibilities
- Example: "Research Specialist" not just "Helper"

**Write Good Task Descriptions**
- Be specific about what you want
- Break big tasks into smaller steps
- Order tasks logically for sequential mode
- Example: "Research AI trends in 2024" not "Look up AI stuff"

**Keep Teams Small**
- 3-5 agents is optimal
- More agents = more complexity
- Add agents only when needed
- Better to have focused experts than many generalists

### Choosing the Right Mode

- **New to teams?** Start with sequential mode
- **Need planning?** Use coordinate mode
- **Have specialists?** Use route mode
- **Not sure?** Sequential works for 80% of cases

### Performance Tips

- Keep task lists reasonable (5-10 tasks max)
- Use faster models for simple agents
- Save expensive models for critical agents
- In coordinate mode, always set `model` for the leader

### Cost Management

- Sequential mode is most cost-effective
- Coordinate mode costs more (leader makes extra calls)
- Route mode is cheapest (only routing + one agent)
- Consider using cheaper models for non-critical agents
