## Overview

Chat enables you to build stateful conversational sessions with automatic memory management, cost tracking, and session analytics. It wraps an Agent with session persistence, memory integration, and usage metrics.

## Key Features

- **Session Management**: Unique session/user identification with state tracking
- **Memory Integration**: Conversation history, summarization, and user profile analysis
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time token usage and cost monitoring
- **Streaming Support**: Both blocking and streaming response modes
- **History Manipulation**: Delete messages, remove attachments
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## Example

```python
import asyncio
from upsonic import Agent, Chat


async def main():
    agent = Agent("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5")

    chat = Chat(
        session_id="user123_session1",
        user_id="user123",
        agent=agent
    )

    response = await chat.invoke("Hello, how are you?")
    print(response)

    print(f"Total cost: ${chat.total_cost:.4f}")
    print(f"Messages: {len(chat.all_messages)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
