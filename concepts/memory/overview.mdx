## What is Memory?

Memory gives your agents the ability to remember. Without memory, every conversation starts fresh - your agent doesn't remember what you talked about before or who you are. With memory, your agents can:

- **Remember conversations** - Reference previous messages and maintain context
- **Learn about users** - Understand preferences, expertise level, and communication style
- **Improve over time** - Build a complete picture of each user across all interactions
- **Reduce repetition** - Never ask for the same information twice

## How Memory Works

Memory works in two phases - before and after each conversation:

**Before Each Conversation:**
1. Loads the user's profile (if you're using user analysis memory)
2. Retrieves the conversation summary (if you're using summary memory)
3. Pulls up previous messages (if you're using conversation memory)
4. Gives all this context to your agent automatically

**After Each Conversation:**
1. Saves the new messages to history
2. Updates the conversation summary
3. Analyzes what the agent learned about the user
4. Stores everything for next time

You don't have to do anything - memory handles it all automatically.
