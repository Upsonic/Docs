## What is The Selection Criteria?

Choose memory types based on your specific needs:

| Memory Type | When to Use | Requirements |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Conversation Memory** | Customer support, tutoring, detailed conversations | `session_id` |
| **Summary Memory** | Long conversations, cost reduction | `session_id`, `model` |
| **User Analysis Memory** | Personalization, user preferences | `user_id`, `model` |

## Making Combination of Memory

You can use one type or combine all three for the most powerful memory system:

### Basic Conversation Memory Only

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.storage import Memory
from upsonic.storage.providers.in_memory import InMemoryStorage

# Basic conversation memory only
storage = InMemoryStorage()
memory = Memory(
    storage=storage,
    session_id="session_001",
    full_session_memory=True
)

# Create agent with memory
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o", memory=memory)

# First conversation
task1 = Task("My name is Alice and I love Python")
result1 = agent.do(task1)

# Second conversation - agent remembers
task2 = Task("What's my name and favorite language?")
result2 = agent.do(task2)
print(result2)  # Output: Your name is Alice and you love Python
```

### All Three Memory Types

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.storage import Memory
from upsonic.storage.providers.in_memory import InMemoryStorage

# All three memory types combined
storage = InMemoryStorage()
memory = Memory(
    storage=storage,
    session_id="session_001",
    user_id="user_001",
    full_session_memory=True,
    summary_memory=True,
    user_analysis_memory=True,
    model="openai/gpt-4o"
)

# Create agent with comprehensive memory
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o", memory=memory)

# First conversation - agent stores everything
task1 = Task("Hi! I'm Bob, a backend developer who loves microservices")
result1 = agent.do(task1)

# Agent uses all memory types for rich context
task2 = Task("What can you tell me about my background?")
result2 = agent.do(task2)
print(result2)
```

## Use Case for Conversation Memory

- **Customer Support**: Maintain context across support tickets
- **Tutoring**: Remember what topics have been covered
- **Long Conversations**: Keep track of detailed discussions
- **Debugging Sessions**: Remember error states and solutions

## Use Case for Summary Memory

- **Long Sessions**: Reduce token costs for very long conversations
- **Meeting Notes**: Automatically summarize key points
- **Documentation**: Create evolving summaries of complex topics
- **Cost Optimization**: Maintain context without full history

## Use Case for User Analysis Memory

- **Personalization**: Adapt responses to user preferences
- **Learning Systems**: Track user progress and expertise
- **Customer Profiles**: Build comprehensive user understanding
- **Adaptive Interfaces**: Customize experience based on user traits
