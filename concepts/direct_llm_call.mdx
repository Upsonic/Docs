## What is Direct LLM Call

As the capacity of LLMs increases, the scope of what they can accomplish in a single request also expands significantly. Previously, LLMs were limited to making just a few tool calls, but now they can engage in deep thinking and perform hundreds of tool calls. In the Upsonic framework, we assess this situation as follows:

* Agents are LLMs that are specifically characterized and focused on a particular domain.

* Should use agents when they need to know the organization's objective, goals, and rules.

However, apart from these two cases, there are many other cases that can be handled by an LLM. For this reason, we added a feature called Direct LLM Call.

## Making a Direct LLM Call

To send a task directly to an LLM without any layers in between, you should use the Direct object. It works with the same interface as agents, making it easy to switch or design according to your needs.

```python
from upsonic import Task, Direct

task = Task("Create History paper of LLMs")


Direct.print_do(task)
# or Direct.do(task)

```

## Changing LLM Model

You can set the `model` as you want via model parameter of  `do` and `print_do` commands.

```python
Direct.print_do(task, model="azure/gpt-4o")
```
