## Overview

The Upsonic framework leverages client-server architecture, offering significant advantages in deployment flexibility and computational capabilities. This architectural design enables the runtime environment to operate independently from the main environment, allowing for enhanced resource utilization and scalable task execution across multiple agents.

Furthermore, the framework provides comprehensive operational management features, including seamless scaling of Agentic operations, robust error tracking mechanisms, and enhanced security through system isolation. These capabilities ensure reliable and secure execution of complex agent-based tasks while maintaining system integrity and performance optimization.



## Creating LocalServer

The Upsonic framework has an automatic system to easily set up the client-server architecture locally. This way, you can safely and automatically use this architecture even on a small scale and easily complete your tasks. The LocalServer will start securely and shut down safely when agent operations are complete. Debugging and all other processes are managed compatibly within the client system.
