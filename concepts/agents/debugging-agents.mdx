Debug agents by enabling debug mode to see detailed execution information including tool calls, context processing, and model interactions.

## Enable Debug Mode

The simplest way to debug is enabling the `debug` flag when running a task.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Create agent and task
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-4o")
task = Task("Calculate 25 * 4 and explain the steps")

# Execute with debug mode
result = agent.do(task, debug=True)
print(result)
```

When debug mode is enabled, you'll see detailed logs including:
- Pipeline step execution
- Tool call information
- Context management
- Model request/response details
- Cache hits/misses
- Safety policy checks

## Debug Agent Configuration

You can also enable debug mode at the agent level for persistent debugging across all tasks.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task
from upsonic.tools import tool

# Create a custom tool
@tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply two numbers."""
    return a * b

# Create agent with debug enabled
agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    debug=True,
    show_tool_calls=True
)

# Execute task - debug info shown automatically
task = Task(
    description="Use the multiply tool to calculate 15 * 8",
    tools=[multiply]
)

result = agent.do(task)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

With agent-level debug mode, every execution provides detailed insights into the agent's decision-making process and tool usage.
