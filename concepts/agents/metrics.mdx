# Agent Metrics

## Overview

Your **Agent** keeps a single **usage** object that accumulates metrics over every run (`do`, `print_do`, `stream`, etc.). Use it to monitor total tokens, requests, tool calls, cost, and duration for that agent.

When printing is enabled, an **Agent Metrics** panel is shown after each task so you can see the updated totals.

## What You Can Access

On any `Agent` instance, use **`agent.usage`**. It is a `RunUsage` object (or `None` before the first run). After runs, you get:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| `input_tokens` | Total prompt tokens across all runs |
| `output_tokens` | Total completion tokens across all runs |
| `requests` | Number of LLM requests |
| `tool_calls` | Number of tool calls executed |
| `cost` | Estimated total cost (when available) |
| `duration` | Total execution time (seconds) |

Other fields (e.g. `cache_read_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens`, `time_to_first_token`) are available on the same object when the provider reports them.

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

agent = Agent("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", print=True)
agent.print_do(Task("What is 2 + 2? Reply with one number."))
agent.print_do(Task("What is 3 + 3? Reply with one number."))

# Totals for this agent across all runs
u = agent.usage
print(f"Requests: {u.requests}, Input: {u.input_tokens}, Output: {u.output_tokens}, Tool calls: {u.tool_calls}, Cost: ${u.cost:.4f}")
```
