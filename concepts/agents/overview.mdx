The `Agent` class is the core agent implementation in Upsonic, providing a powerful and flexible interface for creating AI agents with advanced capabilities including memory management, safety policies, reliability layers, and sophisticated tool integration.

## Overview

The `Agent` can be created with minimal configuration or with extensive customization to suit your specific needs. The agent provides a robust foundation for AI-powered applications with built-in support for various advanced features.

### Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Built-in support for session memory, user profiles, and conversation history
- **Safety Policies**: Configurable user and agent policies for content filtering and validation
- **Reliability Layer**: Advanced hallucination prevention and content validation
- **Tool Integration**: Sophisticated tool processing with behavioral wrappers
- **Thinking & Reasoning**: Optional advanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks
- **Caching**: Built-in caching system for improved performance

## Basic Example

The simplest way to create an agent is with default settings:

```python
from upsonic import Agent

# Create agent with default settings
agent = Agent()
```

**Warning**: When creating an agent without specifying a model, it defaults to `"openai/gpt-4o"`. Make sure you have the appropriate API key set in your environment.
