## What is an Agent?

An `Agent` is an autonomous AI entity that can understand natural language instructions, make decisions, use tools, and execute tasks. Think of an agent as an AI employee with specific capabilities, expertise, and behavior patterns.

Agents in Upsonic are built on Large Language Models (LLMs) but enhanced with memory, safety policies, tools, and reasoning capabilities. They can work independently or collaborate in teams to solve complex problems.

## Why use Agents?

Agents enable you to:

- **Automate complex workflows**: Handle multi-step processes that require decision-making
- **Add intelligence to systems**: Integrate AI capabilities into your existing applications
- **Scale expertise**: Create specialized AI workers for different domains (research, analysis, customer service, etc.)
- **Maintain context**: Remember past interactions and learn from experience
- **Ensure safety**: Enforce policies and guardrails on AI behavior
- **Use external tools**: Connect to APIs, databases, and services for real-time data

## Overview

The `Agent` class is the core implementation in Upsonic, providing a powerful and flexible interface for creating AI agents. Agents can be created with minimal configuration or extensively customized to suit your specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Built-in support for session memory, user profiles, and conversation history
- **Safety Policies**: Configurable user and agent policies for content filtering and validation
- **Reliability Layer**: Advanced hallucination prevention and content validation
- **Tool Integration**: Sophisticated tool processing with behavioral wrappers
- **Thinking & Reasoning**: Optional advanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks
- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others!
- **Streaming**: Real-time response streaming for better user experience
- **Caching**: Built-in caching system for improved performance
- **Canvas Integration**: Support for persistent text editing and collaboration

## Example

### Basic Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Create an agent
agent = Agent("openai/gpt-5")

# Execute with Task object
task = Task("What is 2 + 2?")
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)  # Output: 4

# Or execute directly with a string (auto-converted to Task)
result = agent.do("What is 2 + 2?")
print(result)  # Output: 4
```

<Warning>
When creating an agent without specifying a model, it defaults to `"openai/gpt-5"`. Make sure you have the appropriate API key set in your environment.
</Warning>

### Deep Agent Example

```python
import asyncio
from upsonic.agent.deepagent import DeepAgent
from upsonic import Task

async def main():
    # Create a deep agent
    agent = DeepAgent(model="openai/gpt-5")
    
    # Create a complex task
    task = Task(
        description="Research Python web frameworks and create a comparison report. Save findings to /research/frameworks.txt and create /reports/comparison.txt"
    )
    
    # Execute - agent will automatically create todos and manage the workflow
    result = await agent.do_async(task)
    print(result)
    
    # Check files created
    files = await agent.filesystem_backend.glob("/**/*.txt")
    print(f"Files created: {files}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
