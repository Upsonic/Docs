The Workspace feature allows you to configure your agent using an `Agents.md` file stored in a designated folder. When a workspace is set, the agent reads the configuration file and includes it in the system prompt, and can generate a dynamic greeting message at the start of each session.

## Overview

When you set a `workspace` path on an Agent:

1. **Configuration Loading**: The agent reads the `Agents.md` file from the workspace folder and includes it in the system prompt
2. **Session Greeting**: You can call `execute_workspace_greeting()` to generate a personalized greeting based on the configuration

## Example

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Create an agent with workspace
agent = Agent(
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
    workspace="/path/to/my_agent_folder",
    session_id="user_session_001"
)

# Execute the workspace greeting (optional, for new sessions)
greeting = agent.execute_workspace_greeting()
print(greeting)

# Run tasks - the Agents.md content is included in the system prompt
task = Task("What can you help me with?")
result = agent.do(task)
print(result)
```

## The AGENTS.md File

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your workspace folder to define your agent's behavior. We provide a ready-to-use template with memory management, safety rules, group chat guidelines, and more.

The content of this file is automatically injected into the agent's system prompt wrapped in `<AgentConfiguration>` tags.

## Integration with Interfaces

When using Upsonic [interfaces](/concepts/interfaces/Overview) (Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp), the workspace greeting is automatically called when a user resets their session with the `/reset` command. The greeting response is sent to the user, providing a fresh start with a personalized introduction.
