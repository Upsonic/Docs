You can embed your organization's identity and objectives directly into the `Agent`. this ensures that the agent acts as a representative of your company, aligning with your brand voice and business goals.

## adding Company Context

The `Agent` class accepts several parameters to define the company context:

- `company_name`: The name of your organization.
- `company_description`: A brief description of what your company does.
- `company_objective`: The high-level goals or mission.
- `company_url`: The main website URL.

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

agent = Agent(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    name="SupportBot",
    # Define Company Context
    company_name="TechFlow Solutions",
    company_description="A leading provider of cloud optimization tools.",
    company_objective="To help businesses reduce cloud costs by 30%.",
    company_url="https://techflow.example.com"
)

# The agent now knows who it works for
task = Task("Draft a welcome email to a new client.")
result = agent.do(task)

print(result)
# Output will likely mention TechFlow Solutions and align with the cost-reduction mission.
```

## How It Works

This information is injected into the agent's system prompt. It provides a persistent background context ("grounding") that influences:

1.  **Tone & Voice**: Professional and aligned with the company description.
2.  **Goal Alignment**: Responses are steered towards the `company_objective`.
3.  **Self-Identification**: The agent knows "who" it is representing.

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: A clear `company_objective` helps the agent prioritize tasks.
- **URL Context**: Providing `company_url` gives the agent a reference point if it needs to generate links or refer to the website (especially if using browsing tools).
