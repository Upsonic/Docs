Thinking capabilities enable your agent to think through problems step-by-step, providing more structured and thoughtful responses. This feature is essential for complex financial analysis, risk assessment, and multi-step problem solving.

## Enabling Thinking

To enable thinking capabilities, set `enable_thinking_tool=True` when creating your agent:

```python
from upsonic import Agent

# Enable thinking for financial analysis
agent = Agent(
    name="FinancialAnalyst",
    enable_thinking_tool=True,
    debug=True
)
```

## How Thinking Works

When thinking is enabled, the agent follows a structured "blueprint" approach:

1. **Strategic Planning**: The agent creates a complete, sequential plan of tool calls
2. **Automated Execution**: An orchestrator executes the plan step-by-step
3. **Final Synthesis**: The agent synthesizes results into a comprehensive answer

### Thinking vs. Basic Mode

| Feature | Basic Mode | Thinking Mode |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Planning** | Ad-hoc tool calls | Structured blueprint creation |
| **Execution** | Direct tool execution | Orchestrated step-by-step execution |
| **Analysis** | Immediate responses | Thoughtful synthesis of results |
| **Use Cases** | Simple queries | Complex multi-step analysis |

## Thinking Configuration

### Agent-Level Thinking

```python
# Enable thinking for all tasks
agent = Agent(
    name="RiskAnalyst",
    enable_thinking_tool=True
)
```

### Task-Level Thinking

```python
from upsonic import Task

# Override agent settings for specific task
task = Task(
    description="Analyze market volatility and provide investment recommendations",
    enable_thinking_tool=True  # Enable thinking for this specific task
)

result = agent.print_do(task)
```

### Mixed Configuration

```python
# Agent with thinking enabled
agent = Agent(
    name="BankingAgent",
    enable_thinking_tool=True
)

# Simple task without thinking
simple_task = Task(
    description="What is the current interest rate?",
    enable_thinking_tool=False  # Disable thinking for simple queries
)

# Complex task with thinking
complex_task = Task(
    description="Analyze portfolio risk and recommend rebalancing strategy",
    enable_thinking_tool=True  # Keep thinking for complex analysis
)
```

## Thinking Use Cases

Thinking is ideal for:

- **Financial Analysis**: Multi-step investment analysis and risk assessment
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Complex compliance checking and documentation
- **Portfolio Management**: Comprehensive portfolio analysis and recommendations
- **Risk Assessment**: Detailed risk evaluation across multiple factors
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term financial planning and strategy development

### Example: Financial Risk Analysis

```python
from upsonic import Agent, Task

# Create agent with thinking capabilities
agent = Agent(
    name="RiskAssessmentAgent",
    enable_thinking_tool=True,
    debug=True
)

# Create a complex financial analysis task
task = Task(
    description="""
    Analyze the following investment scenario and provide comprehensive risk assessment:
    
    A client has $500K to invest across:
    1. 40% in technology stocks (high volatility)
    2. 30% in government bonds (low risk)
    3. 20% in real estate REITs (medium risk)
    4. 10% in cryptocurrency (very high volatility)
    
    Consider market conditions, diversification benefits, and provide specific recommendations
    for risk mitigation and portfolio optimization.
    """,
    enable_thinking_tool=True
)

# Execute with thinking
result = agent.print_do(task)
```

### Example: Banking Compliance Analysis

```python
task = Task(
    description="""
    Review the following banking transaction for compliance:
    
    Transaction: $50,000 wire transfer from Business Account A to Personal Account B
    Customer: High-net-worth individual with $2M+ in assets
    Purpose: Real estate investment
    Timing: End of quarter
    
    Analyze for:
    1. AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance
    2. KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements
    3. Regulatory reporting obligations
    4. Risk assessment and documentation needs
    """,
    enable_thinking_tool=True
)

result = agent.print_do(task)
```

## Thinking Output Structure

When thinking is enabled, the agent provides:

1. **Strategic Analysis**: Detailed reasoning about the problem
2. **Execution Plan**: Step-by-step tool call sequence
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identification of potential issues
4. **Final Synthesis**: Comprehensive answer based on all gathered information

### Example Thinking Flow

```
1. Agent analyzes the request and creates a plan
2. Orchestrator executes: get_market_data → analyze_risk → check_compliance
3. Agent synthesizes results into final recommendation
```

## Performance Considerations

**Important**: Thinking capabilities consume more tokens and processing time than basic mode. Monitor your usage and costs when using thinking for production applications.

```python
# Monitor performance with debug mode
agent = Agent(
    name="FinancialAnalyst",
    enable_thinking_tool=True,
    debug=True  # Shows detailed execution metrics
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use for Complex Tasks**: Enable thinking for multi-step financial analysis
2. **Disable for Simple Queries**: Use basic mode for straightforward questions
3. **Monitor Costs**: Track token usage with thinking enabled
4. **Debug Mode**: Use debug mode during development to understand the process
5. **Task-Specific Control**: Override agent settings for specific tasks when needed
6. **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed, specific instructions for better planning
7. **Tool Availability**: Ensure all required tools are available for the planned sequence

Thinking provides a powerful way to handle complex financial scenarios that require structured thinking and comprehensive analysis, making it essential for sophisticated banking and fintec
