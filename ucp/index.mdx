# Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)

![UCP Integration Banner](/images/ucp-integration-banner.png)

Welcome to Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)! This section provides you with everything you need to know about UCP and how to integrate it with Upsonic AI Agent Framework.

## What is UCP?

Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) is an open protocol that creates a common language between platforms, agents, and businesses. It standardizes the entire commerce lifecycle—from checkout processes to order management. This enables the ecosystem to work together seamlessly without needing custom integrations.

UCP provides a unified interface for:
- **Merchant Discovery**: Discover merchant capabilities and profiles through standardized endpoints
- **Checkout Sessions**: Create, update, complete, and cancel checkout sessions across platforms
- **Order Management**: Track and manage orders consistently with standardized APIs
- **Payment Processing**: Handle payments through unified payment interfaces
- **Webhooks**: Receive order events and updates through standardized webhook endpoints

By adopting UCP, businesses can integrate with AI shopping assistants and other commerce platforms without building custom APIs for each integration.

## Use Cases

### AI Shopping Assistant

One of the most powerful use cases for UCP is building **AI-powered shopping assistants**. These assistants can:

- Discover merchant capabilities and profiles through standardized discovery endpoints
- Create and manage checkout sessions seamlessly across different retailers
- Complete purchases through unified checkout flows
- Track orders and receive updates via standardized webhooks
- Handle payments consistently across all UCP-compatible platforms

With UCP, an AI shopping assistant powered by Upsonic can interact with any UCP-compatible retailer without requiring custom integrations. This dramatically reduces development time and enables agents to provide a consistent shopping experience across the entire commerce ecosystem.
